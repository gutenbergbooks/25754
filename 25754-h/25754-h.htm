<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>AT CALAMITY CROSSING</h3>
</div>

<p>Getting up the shoulder of the mesa was
no easy job, but judging from the actions
and appearance of wiry pony and rider it was a
job that would be accomplished. For part of the
distance, it is true, the man thought it best to dismount,
drive the pony ahead of him, and follow
on foot. At length, however, they reached the
top of the mesa, and after a breathing spell the
man mounted and rode across the table-land.
</p>
<p>A short lope brought pony and rider to a point
where the mesa sloped down again to meet a plain
that stretched for miles, to merge into some foothills.
A faint trail came from somewhere through
the foothills, wound over the plain, and followed
a slope that descended to a river below the rider,
crossed the stream, led over a level, up another
slope, to another plain, and so away into the distance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>Up and down the river the water ran deeply in
a canyon, the painted buttes that flanked it lending
an appearance of constriction to its course, but at
the crossing it broadened formidably and swirled
splashingly around numerous rocks that littered its
course.
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s gaze rested briefly on the river and
the crossing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s travelin&#8217; some, this mornin&#8217;,&#8221; he said
aloud, mentally referring to the water. &#8220;I
reckon that mud over there must be hub deep
on a buckboard,&#8221; he added, looking at the
level on the opposite side of the crossing. &#8220;I&#8217;d
say, if anybody was to ask me, that last night&#8217;s
rain has made Calamity some risky this mornin&#8217;&mdash;for
a buckboard.&#8221; He drew out a silver
timepiece and consulted it with grave deliberation.
&#8220;It&#8217;s eleven. They&#8217;d be due about now&mdash;if
the Eight O&#8217;clock was on time&mdash;which
she&#8217;s never been knowed to be.&#8221; He returned
the timepiece to the pocket and rode along the
edge of the mesa away from the river, his gaze
concentrated at the point where the trail on
the plains below him vanished into the distant
foothills. A little later he again halted the pony,
swung crossways in the saddle and rolled a cigarette,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
and while smoking and watching drew out
two pistols, took out the cylinders, replaced them,
and wiped and polished the metal until the guns
glittered brightly in the swimming sunlight. He
considered them long before restoring them to
their places, doubt in his gaze. &#8220;I reckon she&#8217;s
been raised a lot different,&#8221; was his mental conclusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But anyway, I reckon there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; in
Poughkeepsie&#8217;s name to give anyone comin&#8217; from
there any right to put on airs.&#8221; He tossed the butt
of the cigarette away and frowned, continuing his
soliloquy: &#8220;The Flyin&#8217; W ain&#8217;t no place for a
lady. Jim Pickett an&#8217; Tom Chavis ain&#8217;t fit for no
lady to look at&mdash;let alone talkin&#8217; to them.
There&#8217;s others, too. Now, if she was comin&#8217; to
the Diamond H&mdash;why, shucks! Mebbe she
wouldn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m any better than Pickett an&#8217;
Chavis! If she looks anything like her picture,
though, she&#8217;s got sense. An&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw the pony flick its ears erect, and he
followed its gaze to see on the plain&#8217;s trail, far
over near where it melted into the foothills, a
moving speck crawling toward him.
</p>
<p>He swung back into the saddle and smilingly
patted the pony&#8217;s neck.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You was expectin&#8217; them too, wasn&#8217;t you,
Patches? I reckon you&#8217;re a right knowin&#8217; horse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He wheeled the pony and urged it slowly back
over the mesa, riding along near the edge until he
reached a point behind a heavy post-oak thicket,
where he pulled the pony to a halt. From here
he would not be observed from the trail on the
plains, and he again twisted in the saddle, sagging
against the high pommel and drawing the wide
brim of his hat well over his eyes, shading them as
he peered intently at the moving speck.
</p>
<p>He watched for half an hour, while the speck
grew larger in his vision, finally assuming definite
shape. He recognized the buckboard and the
blacks that were pulling it; they had been inseparable
during the past two years&mdash;for Bill Harkness,
the Flying W owner, would drive no others
after his last sickness had seized him, the sickness
which had finally finished him some months before.
The blacks were coming rapidly, shortening
the distance with the tireless lope that the plains&#8217;
animal uses so effectively, and as they neared the
point on the mesa where the rider had stationed
himself, the latter parted the branches of the
thicket and peered between them, his eyes agleam,
the color deepening in his face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s four of them in the buckboard,&#8221; he
said aloud, astonished, as the vehicle came nearer;
&#8220;an&#8217; Wes Vickers ain&#8217;t with them! Now, what
do you think of that! Wes told me there&#8217;d be
only the girl an&#8217; her aunt an&#8217; uncle. It&#8217;s a man,
too, an&#8217; he&#8217;s doin&#8217; the drivin&#8217;! I reckon Wes got
drunk an&#8217; they left him behind.&#8221; He reflected a
moment, watching with narrowed eyes, his brows
in a frown. &#8220;That guy doin&#8217; the drivin&#8217; is a
stranger, Patches,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s mighty
plain. Four in the buckboard, with them bags
an&#8217; trunks an&#8217; things, makes a full house, an&#8217; there
wasn&#8217;t no room for Wes!&#8221; He grinned.
</p>
<p>The buckboard swung close to the foot of the
slope below him, and he eagerly scrutinized the
occupants, his gaze lingering long on the girl on
the seat beside the driver. She had looked for
one flashing instant toward him, her attention
drawn, no doubt, by the fringing green of the
mesa, and he had caught a good glimpse of her
face. It was just like the picture that Wes Vickers
had surreptitiously brought to him one day
some weeks before, after Harkness&#8217; death, when,
in talking with Wes about the niece who was now
the sole owner of the Flying W, and who was coming
soon to manage her property, he had evinced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
curiosity. He had kept the picture, in spite of
Vickers&#8217; remonstrances, and had studied it many
times. He studied it now, after the passage of
the buckboard, and was supremely pleased, for
the likeness did not flatter her.
</p>
<p>Displeasure came into his eyes, though, when he
thought of the driver. He was strangely disturbed
over the thought that the driver had
accompanied her from the East. He knew the
driver was an Easterner, for no Westerner would
ever rig himself out in such an absurd fashion&mdash;the
cream-colored Stetson with the high pointed
crown, extra wide brim with nickel spangles
around the band, a white shirt with a broad turndown
collar and a flowing colored tie&mdash;blue; a
cartridge belt that fitted snugly around his waist,
yellow with newness, so that the man on the mesa
almost imagined he could hear it creak when its
owner moved; corduroy riding-breeches, tight at
the knees, and glistening boots with stiff tops.
And&mdash;here the observer&#8217;s eyes gleamed with
derision&mdash;as the buckboard passed, he had
caught a glimpse of a nickeled spur, with long
rowels, on one of the ridiculous boots.
</p>
<p>He chuckled, his face wreathing in smiles as he
urged the pony along the edge of the mesa, following
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
the buckboard. He drew up presently at a
point just above the buckboard, keeping discreetly
behind some brush that he might not be seen, and
gravely considered the vehicle and its occupants.
The buckboard had stopped at the edge of the
water, and the blacks were drinking. The girl
was talking; the watcher heard her voice distinctly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What a rough, grim country!&#8221; she said. &#8220;It
is beautiful, though.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a knowin&#8217; girl,&#8221; mused the rider,
strangely pleased that she should like the world
he lived in. For it was his world; he had been
born here.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so, Willard?&#8221; added the girl.
</p>
<p>The rider strained his ears for the answer. It
came, grumblingly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s well enough&mdash;for the clodhoppers
that live here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl laughed tolerantly; the rider on the
mesa smiled. &#8220;I reckon I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to like Willard
a heap, Patches,&#8221; he said to the pony; &#8220;he&#8217;s
runnin&#8217; down our country.&#8221; He considered the
girl and the driver gravely, and again spoke to
the pony. &#8220;Do you reckon he&#8217;s her brother,
Patches? I expect it ain&#8217;t possible&mdash;they&#8217;re so
different.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it is quite safe?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s
voice reached him again; she was looking at the
water of the crossing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vickers said it was,&#8221; the driver replied.
&#8220;He ought to know.&#8221; His tone was irritable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s her brother, I reckon,&#8221; reflected the man
on the mesa; &#8220;no lover would talk that way to
his girl.&#8221; There was relief in his voice, for he
had been hoping that the man was a brother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Vickers said to swing sharply to the left after
passing the middle,&#8221; declared the driver sonorously,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t see any wagon tracks&mdash;that
miserable rain last night must have obliterated
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon the rain has <i>obliterated</i> them,&#8221;
grinned the rider, laboring with the word, &#8220;if that
means wipin&#8217; them out. Leastways, they ain&#8217;t
there any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel quite sure that Mr. Vickers said to
turn to the right after passing the middle, Willard,&#8221;
came the girl&#8217;s voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly ought to be able to remember that,
Ruth!&#8221; said the driver, gruffly. &#8220;I heard him
distinctly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; returned the girl with a nervous little
laugh, &#8220;perhaps I was mistaken, after all.&#8221; She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
placed a hand lightly on the driver&#8217;s arm. And
the words she spoke then were not audible to the
rider, so softly were they uttered. And the driver
laughed with satisfaction. &#8220;You&#8217;ve said it!&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;I&#8217;m certainly able to pilot this ship
to safety!&#8221; He pulled on the reins and spoke
sharply to the blacks. They responded with a
jerk that threw the occupants of the buckboard
against the backs of the seats.
</p>
<p>The rider&#8217;s eyes gleamed. &#8220;Hush!&#8221; he said,
addressing no one in particular. &#8220;Calamity&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to claim another victim!&#8221; He raised one
hand to his lips, making a funnel of it. He was
about to shout at the driver, but thought better of
the idea and let the hand drop. &#8220;Shucks,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I reckon there ain&#8217;t any real danger. But
I expect the boss gasser of the outfit will be gettin&#8217;
his&#8217;n pretty quick now.&#8221; He leaned forward and
watched the buckboard, his lean under jaw thrown
forward, a grim smile on his lips. He noted
with satisfaction that the elderly couple in the rear
seat, and the girl in the front one, were holding
on tightly, and that the driver, busy with the reins,
was swaying from one side to the other as the
wagon bumped over the impeding stones of the
river bed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>The blacks reached the middle of the stream
safely and were crowding of their own accord to
the right, when the driver threw his weight on
the left rein and swung them sharply in that direction.
For a few feet they traveled evenly enough
but when they were still some distance from the
bank, the horse on the left sank quickly to his
shoulders, lunged, stood on his hind legs and
pawed the air impotently, and then settled back,
snorting and trembling.
</p>
<p>Too late the driver saw his error. As the left
horse sank he threw his weight on the right rein
as though to remedy the accident. This movement
threw him off his balance, and he slipped off
the seat, clawing and scrambling; at the instant
the front of the buckboard dipped and sank, disappearing
with a splash into the muddy water.
It had gone down awry, the girl&#8217;s side high out
of the water, the girl herself clinging to the edge
of the seat, out of the water&#8217;s reach, the elderly
couple in the rear also safe and dry, but plainly
frightened.
</p>
<p>The girl did not scream; the rider on the mesa
noted this with satisfaction. She was talking,
though, to the driver, who at first had disappeared,
only to reappear an instant later, blowing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
and cursing, his head and shoulders out of the
water, his ridiculous hat floating serenely down
stream, the reins still in his hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he&#8217;s discovered that Vickers told
him to swing to the right,&#8221; grinned the rider from
his elevation. He watched the driver until he
gained the bank and stood there, dripping, gesticulating,
impotent rage consuming him. The
buckboard could not be moved without endangering
the comfort of the remaining occupants, and
without assistance they must inevitably stay where
they were. And so the rider on the mesa wheeled
his pony and sent it toward the edge of the mesa
where a gentle slope swept downward to the
plains.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve sure got to rescue her,&#8221; he said,
grinning with some embarrassment, &#8220;though I&#8217;m
mighty sorry that Willard had to get his new
clothes wet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke coaxingly to the pony; it stepped
gingerly over the edge of the mesa and began the
descent, sending stones and sand helter-skelter
before it, the rider sitting tall and loose in the
saddle, the reins hanging, he trusting entirely to
the pony&#8217;s wisdom.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE SYMPATHETIC RESCUER</h3>
</div>

<p>Halfway down the slope, the rider turned
and saw that Willard and the occupants of
the buckboard were watching him. The color in
his cheeks grew deeper and his embarrassment
increased, for he noted that the girl had faced
squarely around toward him, had forgotten her
precarious position; her hands were clasped as
though she were praying for his safety. The
aunt and uncle, too, were twisted in their seat,
leaning toward him in rigid attitudes, and Willard,
safe on his bank, was standing with clenched
hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you reckon we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to break our necks,
you piebald outlaw,&#8221; the rider said to the pony.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; as the animal whinnied gently at the
sound of his voice, &#8220;there&#8217;s some people that do,
an&#8217; if you&#8217;ve got any respect for them you&#8217;ll be
mighty careful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The descent was accomplished in a brief time,
and then Patches and his rider went forward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
toward the mired buckboard and its occupants,
the pony unconcernedly, its rider, having conquered
his embarrassment, serene, steady of eye,
inwardly amused.
</p>
<p>When he reached the water&#8217;s edge he halted
Patches. Sitting motionless in the saddle, he
quietly contemplated the occupants of the buckboard.
He had come to help them, but he was
not going to proffer his services until he was sure
they would be welcomed. He had heard stories
of the snobbishness and independence of some
Easterners.
</p>
<p>And so he sat there long, for the occupants of
the buckboard, knowing nothing of his intentions,
were in their turn awaiting some word from him.
</p>
<p>No word came. He looked down, interestedly
watching Patches drink. Then, when the pony
had finished, he looked up, straight at the girl.
She was sitting very erect&mdash;as erect as she could
in the circumstances, trying hard to repress her
anger over his inaction. She could see that he
was deliberately delaying. And she met his gaze
coldly.
</p>
<p>He looked from the girl to Willard. The
Easterner was examining a small pistol that he
had drawn from a yellow holster at his waist, so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
high on his waist that he had been compelled to
bend his elbow in an acute angle to get it out.
His hands were trembling, whether from the
wetting he had received or from doubt as to the
rider&#8217;s intentions, was a question that the rider
did not bother with. He looked again at the
girl. Doubt had come into her eyes; she was
looking half fearfully at him, and he saw that
she half suspected him of being a desperado,
intent on doing harm. He grinned, moved to
mirth.
</p>
<p>She was reassured; that smile had done it.
She returned it, a little ruefully. And she felt
that, in view of the circumstances, she might dispense
with formalities and get right down to
business. For her seat was uncomfortable, and
Aunt Martha and Uncle Jepson were anxious, to
say nothing of Willard, who had placed his pistol
behind him, determined, if the man turned out to
be a highwayman, to defend his party to the last.
</p>
<p>But still the rider did not move. There was
no hurry; only Willard seemed to be really suffering,
for the winter&#8217;s chill had not yet gone out
of the air. But then, Willard had earned his
ducking.
</p>
<p>The girl cleared her throat. &#8220;We have had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
an accident,&#8221; she informed the rider, her voice a
little husky.
</p>
<p>At this word he swept his hat from his head and
bowed to her. &#8220;Why, I reckon you have,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you have no driver?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; returned the girl hesitatingly, for
she thought she detected sarcasm in his voice,
and she had to look twice at him to make sure&mdash;and
then she couldn&#8217;t have told. &#8220;The gentleman
on the bank, there, is our driver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The gentleman on the bank, eh?&#8221; drawled
the rider. And now for the first time he seemed
to become aware of Willard&#8217;s presence, for he
looked narrowly at him. &#8220;Why, he&#8217;s all wet!&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;I expect he come pretty near
drownin&#8217;, didn&#8217;t he, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; He looked again
at the girl, astonishment in his eyes. &#8220;An&#8217; so
he drove you into that suck-hole, an&#8217; he got
throwed out! Wasn&#8217;t there no one to tell him
that Calamity ain&#8217;t to be trusted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Vickers told us to keep to the right after
reaching the middle,&#8221; said the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I distinctly understood him to say the left,
Ruth,&#8221; growled Willard.
</p>
<p>The rider watched the girl&#8217;s face, saw the color
come into it, and his lips twitched with some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
inward emotion. &#8220;I reckon your brother&#8217;s right,
ma&#8217;am. Vickers wanted to drownd you-all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Masten isn&#8217;t my brother,&#8221; denied the girl.
The color in her face heightened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; said the rider. He bent his
head and patted the pony&#8217;s mane to hide his disappointment.
Again, so it seemed to the girl, he
was deliberately delaying, and she bit her lips
with vexation.
</p>
<p>Willard also seemed to have the same thought,
for he shouted angrily: &#8220;While you are talking
there, my man, I am freezing. Isn&#8217;t there some
way for you to get my party and the wagon out of
there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I expect there&#8217;s a way,&#8221; drawled the
rider, fixing Masten with a steady eye; &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
wonderin&#8217; why you didn&#8217;t mention it before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Lord!&#8221; said Masten to the girl, his disgust
making his voice husky, &#8220;can you imagine
such stupidity?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the girl did not answer; she had seen a
glint in the rider&#8217;s eyes while he had been looking
at Masten which had made her draw a deep
breath. She had seen guile in his eyes, and subtlety,
and much humor. Stupidity! She wondered
how Masten could be so dense!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Then she became aware that the rider was
splashing toward her, and the next instant she
was looking straight at him, with not more than
five feet of space between them. His gaze was
on her with frank curiosity, his lean, strong face
glowing with the bloom of health; his mouth was
firm, his eyes serene, virility and confidence in
every movement of his body. And then he was
speaking to her, his voice low, gentle, respectful,
even deferential. He seemed not to have taken
offense at Willard, seemed to have forgotten him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you-all will have to ride out of here
on my horse, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you reckon
you&#8217;d care to. Why, yes, I expect that&#8217;s right;
I&#8217;d ought to take the old lady an&#8217; gentleman first,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; as the girl indicated them.
</p>
<p>He backed his pony and smiled at Aunt Martha,
who was small, gray, and sweet of face. He
grinned at her&mdash;the grin of a grown boy at his
grandmother.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ll go first, Aunty,&#8221; he said to
her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have you high an&#8217; dry in a jiffy.
You couldn&#8217;t ride there, you know,&#8221; he added, as
Aunt Martha essayed to climb on behind him.
&#8220;This Patches of mine is considerable cantankerous
an&#8217; ain&#8217;t been educated to it. It&#8217;s likely he&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
dump us both, an&#8217; then we&#8217;d be freezin&#8217; too.&#8221;
And he glanced sidelong at Willard.
</p>
<p>Aunt Martha was directed to step on the
edge of the buckboard. Trembling a little,
though smiling, she was lifted bodily and placed
sidewise on the saddle in front of him, and in this
manner was carried to the bank, far up on the
slope out of the deep mud that spread over the
level near the water&#8217;s edge, and set down gently,
voicing her thanks.
</p>
<p>Then the rescuer returned for Uncle Jepson.
On his way to join Aunt Martha, Uncle Jepson,
who had watched the rider narrowly during his
talk with Willard, found time to whisper:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a mule once that wasn&#8217;t any stubborner
than Willard Masten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t recollect how you cured him of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sir, I do. I thumped it out of him!&#8221;
And Uncle Jepson&#8217;s eyes glowed vindictively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ve got a heap of man in you,
sir,&#8221; said the rider. He set Uncle Jepson down
beside Aunt Martha and turned his pony back
toward the river to get his remaining passenger.
Masten waved authoritatively to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s just the same to you, my man, I&#8217;ll assist
Miss Ruth to land. Just ride over here!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>The rider halted the pony and sat loosely in
the saddle, gravely contemplating the driver
across the sea of mud that separated them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you ain&#8217;t froze yet, are you!&#8221; he said
in pretended astonishment. &#8220;Your mouth is
still able to work considerable smooth! An&#8217; so
you want to ride my horse!&#8221; He sat, regarding
the Easterner in deep, feigned amazement.
&#8220;Why, Willard,&#8221; he said when it seemed he had
quite recovered, &#8220;Patches would sure go to sun-fishin&#8217;
an&#8217; dump you off into that little ol&#8217; suck-hole
ag&#8217;in!&#8221; He urged the pony on through
the water to the buckboard and drew up beside
the girl.
</p>
<p>Her face was crimson, for she had not failed
to hear Masten, and it was plain to the rider
that she had divined that jealously had impelled
Masten to insist on the change of riders. Feminine
perverseness, or something stronger, was in
her eyes when the rider caught a glimpse of them
as he brought his pony to a halt beside her. He
might now have made the mistake of referring
to Masten and thus have brought from her a
quick refusal to accompany him, for he had made
his excuse to Masten and to have permitted her
to know the real reason would have been to attack
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
her loyalty. He strongly suspected that she was
determined to make Masten suffer for his obstinacy,
and he rejoiced in her spirit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ready for you now, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you positively certain that Patches won&#8217;t
go to &#8216;sunfishing&#8217; with me?&#8221; she demanded, as
she poised herself on the edge of the buckboard.
He flashed a pleased grin at her, noting with a
quickening pulse the deep, rich color in her cheeks,
the soft white skin, her dancing eyes&mdash;all framed
in the hood of the rain cloak she wore.
</p>
<p>He reached out his hands to her, clasped her
around the waist and swung her to the place on the
saddle formerly occupied by Aunt Martha. If
he held her to him a little more tightly than he
had held Aunt Martha the wind might have been
to blame, for it was blowing some stray wisps of
her hair into his face and he felt a strange intoxication
that he could scarcely control.
</p>
<p>And now, when she was safe on his horse and
there was no further danger that she would refuse
to ride with him, he gave her the answer to her
question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patches wouldn&#8217;t be unpolite to a lady,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said quietly, into her hair; &#8220;he
wouldn&#8217;t throw you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>He could not see her face&mdash;it was too close to
him and his chin was higher than the top of her
head. But he could not fail to catch the mirth in
her voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you lied to Willard!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, ma&#8217;am; I reckon I did. You see,
I didn&#8217;t want to let Patches get all muddied up,
ridin&#8217; over to Willard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are riding him into the mud now!&#8221;
she declared in a strangely muffled voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, so I am, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said gleefully; &#8220;I
reckon I&#8217;m sure a box-head!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He handed her down a minute later, beside
Uncle Jepson and Aunt Martha, and he lingered
another moment near her, for his proximity to
her had set his blood tingling, and there was an
unnamable yearning in his breast to be near her.
He had passed hours in looking upon her picture,
dreaming of this minute, or another like it, and
now that his dream had come true he realized that
fulfilment was sweeter than anticipation. He was
hugely pleased with her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a lot better lookin&#8217; than her picture,&#8221; he
told himself as he watched her. She had her back
to him, talking with her relatives, but she did not
need to face him to arouse his worship. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
I know she was little,&#8221; he charged himself, estimating
her height, &#8220;she won&#8217;t come anywhere
near reachin&#8217; my shoulder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had not forgotten Masten. And a humorous
devil sported in his eye as he wheeled his pony
and fixed his gaze on that gentleman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Speciments travel around most anywheres,&#8221;
he reflected. &#8220;This here&#8217;s a swell head with a
grouch. I reckon he ain&#8217;t a serious friend of
hers, or she wouldn&#8217;t have stood for me rescuin&#8217;
her when he offered himself that generous.&#8221; The
recollection convulsed him, and he bowed his head
over the pony&#8217;s neck to hide the laugh. When he
looked up, it was to see Masten standing rigid,
watching him, wrath on his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;m to stand here and freeze while
you sit over there and laugh your fool head off!&#8221;
shouted the Easterner. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got some dry
clothing in my trunk on the wagon, which I might
put on, if I could induce you to hurry a little.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, shucks. I come mighty near forgettin&#8217;
you, Willard,&#8221; said the rider. &#8220;An&#8217; so you&#8217;ve
got other clothes! Only they&#8217;re in your trunk on
the buckboard, an&#8217; you can&#8217;t get &#8217;em. An&#8217; you&#8217;re
freezin&#8217; an&#8217; I&#8217;m laughin&#8217; at you. You&#8217;ve got a
heap of trouble, ain&#8217;t you, Willard. An&#8217; all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
because you was dead set on goin&#8217; to the left when
you ought to have gone to the right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do hurry! Wont you, please?&#8221; said the
girl&#8217;s voice, close to his stirrup.
</p>
<p>He looked guiltily at her, for he had been
about to say some vitriolic things to Masten,
having almost lost patience with him. But at
her words his slow good nature returned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure goin&#8217; to hurry, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He urged the pony into the water again, rode
to the buckboard, stepped off, and kneeling in the
seat reached into the water and worked with the
harness. Then, walking along the wagon tongue,
which was slightly out of the water, he again
reached into the water and fumbled with the
harness. Then he stepped back, slapped the
blacks and urged them with his voice, and they
floundered out of the water and gained the bank,
where they stood shaking the water from their
glistening bodies.
</p>
<p>He mounted his pony again and rode to the
rear of the buckboard. Taking the braided hair
rope that hung from the pommel of his saddle he
made a hitch around the center of the rear axle.
Then he wheeled his pony until it faced away
from the buckboard, rode the length of the rope
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
carefully, halted when it was taut, and then slowly,
with his end of the rope fastened securely to the
saddle horn, pulled the buckboard to a level on
the river bottom.
</p>
<p>Returning to the rear of the buckboard he
unfastened the rope, coiled it, and rode to the
bank, catching the blacks and leading them up
the slope beyond where the girl, her aunt and
uncle stood. He gently asked Uncle Jepson to
hold the blacks, for fear they might stray, and
then with a smile at the girl and Aunt Martha, he
returned to the buckboard. There he uncoiled
his rope again and attached one end of it to the
tongue of the wagon, again, as before, riding
away until the rope grew taut. Then, with a
word to the pony, the wagon was drawn through
the water to the edge of the sea of mud.
</p>
<p>This mud looked treacherous, but it was the
only way out; and so, after a pause for rest,
he urged the pony on again. The buckboard
traveled its length&mdash;then lurched into a rut and
refused to move another foot, in spite of the
straining of the pony and its rider&#8217;s urgings.
</p>
<p>The rider paused, turned in the saddle and
scratched his head in perplexity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ve run ag&#8217;in a snag, Patches,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
said. He scrutinized the slopes. &#8220;I expect we&#8217;ll
have to try one of them, after all,&#8221; he decided.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were foolish to try to draw the wagon
out with that thing, in the first place,&#8221; loudly
criticized Masten. &#8220;If you had hitched the
horses to the wagon after you had pulled it out
of the hole, why&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rider looked at the fault-finder, his eyes
narrowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if it ain&#8217;t Willard!&#8221; he said, amazed.
&#8220;Standin&#8217; there, workin&#8217; his little old jaw ag&#8217;in!
An&#8217; a-mournin&#8217; because I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to get my feet
wet! Well, shucks. I reckon there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
to do now but to get the blacks an&#8217; hitch &#8217;em
onto the wagon. There&#8217;s a heap of mud there,
of course, but I expect some mud on them right
pretty boots of yours wouldn&#8217;t spoil &#8217;em. I&#8217;ll
lead the blacks over an&#8217; you can work your jaw
on &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Masten, sneering, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had
enough wettings for one day. I have no doubt
that you can get the wagon out, by your own crude
methods. I shall not interfere, you may be sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stalked away from the water&#8217;s edge and
ascended the slope to a point several feet in
advance of the wagon. Standing there, he looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
across the mud at the girl and the others, as
though disdaining to exchange further words with
the rider.
</p>
<p>The latter gazed at him, sidelong, with humorous
malice in his glance. Then he wheeled his
pony, rode back toward the wagon, veered when
almost to it and forced the pony to climb the slope,
thus getting Masten between the rope and the
mud. He pulled the rope taut again, swinging
wagon tongue and wheels at a sharp angle toward
him, drove the spurs into the flanks of the pony
and headed it toward the mud level, swinging so
that the rope described a quarter circle. It was
a time-honored expedient which, he expected,
would produce the jerk releasing the wagon.
</p>
<p>If he expected the action would produce other
results, the rider gave no indication of it. Only
the girl, watching him closely and seeing a hard
gleam in his eyes, sensed that he was determined
to achieve a double result, and she cried out to
Masten. The warning came too late. The taut
rope, making its wide swing, struck Masten in
the small of the back, lifted him, and bore him
resistlessly out into the mud level, where he
landed, face down, while the wagon, released,
swished past him on its way to freedom.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>The rider took the wagon far up the sloping
trail before he brought it to a halt. Then, swinging
it sideways so that it would not roll back into
the mud, he turned and looked back at Masten.
The latter had got to his feet, mud-bespattered,
furious.
</p>
<p>The rider looked from Masten to the girl, his
expression one of hypocritical gravity. The girl&#8217;s
face was flushed with indignation over the affront
offered her friend. She had punished him for his
jealousy, she had taken her part in mildly ridiculing
him. But it was plain to the rider when he
turned and saw her face, that she resented the
indignity she had just witnessed. She was rigid;
her hands were clenched, her arms stiff at her
sides; her voice was icy, even, though husky with
suppressed passion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I must thank you for getting the
wagon out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But that&mdash;that despicable
trick&mdash;&#8221; Her self-control deserted her.
&#8220;I wish I were a man; you would not go
unpunished!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was contrition in his eyes. For an
infinitesimal space he regretted the deed, and his
active mind was already framing an excuse. And
then out of the tail of his eye he saw Uncle Jepson
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
winking violent applause at him, and a broad grin
suffused his face. He made some effort to suppress
it, but deepening wrinkles around his eyes
contradicted the gravity of his lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I wasn&#8217;t reckonin&#8217; to hurt him, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You see, he was right in the way, an&#8217;
I reckon I was feelin&#8217; a bit wild right at that
minute, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221; His gaze went to Masten, who
was scraping mud from his garments with a small
flat stone. The rider&#8217;s eyes grew wide; more
wrinkles appeared around them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve spoiled his white shirt,&#8221; he said as
though speaking to himself, his voice freighted
with awe. And then, as Masten shook a threatening
fist at him, he suddenly yielded to the mirth
that was consuming him and he bowed his head.
</p>
<p>It was Uncle Jepson&#8217;s warning shout that
impelled him to raise his head. He saw Masten
coming toward him, clawing at the foolish holster
at his waist, his eyes flashing murder, his teeth
bared in a snarl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Patches!&#8221; said the rider, his voice coming
with a cold, quick snap. And the piebald
pony, his muscles and thews alive with energy in
an instant, lunged in answer to the quick knee-press,
through the mud, straight at Masten.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>So it was a grim and formidable figure that
Masten looked up at before he could get his
weapon out of his holster. The lean face of the
rider was close to his own, the rider&#8217;s eyes were
steady, blue, and so cold that they made Masten
forget the chill in the air. And one of the heavy
pistols that the rider carried was close to Masten&#8217;s
head, its big muzzle gaping forebodingly at him,
and the rider&#8217;s voice, as he leaned from the saddle,
came tense and low. The girl could not hear:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to this gospel, you mud-wallowin&#8217;
swine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a man&#8217;s country, an&#8217;
you play a man&#8217;s game or you lose out so quick
it&#8217;ll make you dizzy! You been playin&#8217; kid all
through this deal. You&#8217;re grumblin&#8217; an&#8217; whinin&#8217;
ever since I set eyes on you from the edge of the
mesa, there. That little girl thinks you&#8217;re all
wool an&#8217; a yard wide. You come across, clean&mdash;you
hear me! You shape up to man&#8217;s size or I&#8217;ll
hunt you up an&#8217; tear the gizzard out of you! You
jam that there cap-shooter back where it belongs
or I&#8217;ll take it away from you an&#8217; make you eat it!
You hear me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The pistol went back; Masten&#8217;s face was ashen
beneath the mud on it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now grin, you sufferin&#8217; shorthorn!&#8221; came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
the rider&#8217;s voice again, low as before. &#8220;Grin like
you&#8217;d just discovered that I&#8217;m your rich uncle
come from Frisco with a platter full of gold
nuggets which I&#8217;m set on you spendin&#8217; for white
shirts. Grin, or I&#8217;ll salivate you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a grin that wreathed Masten&#8217;s lips&mdash;a
shallow, forced one. But it sufficed for the rider.
He sat erect, his six-shooter disappearing magically,
and the smile on his face when he looked at
the girl, had genuine mirth in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve apologized to Willard, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be cross to each other no more.
I reckon you c&#8217;n forgive me, now, ma&#8217;am. I sure
didn&#8217;t think of bein&#8217; mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl looked doubtfully at Masten, but
because of the mud on his face could see no
expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; she said, reddening
with embarrassment. &#8220;I certainly would not like
to think that anyone who had been so accommodating
as you could be so mean as to deliberately
upset anyone in the mud.&#8221; She looked downward.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I spoke to you as I did,&#8221;
she added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m sorry too, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said gravely.
He urged his pony through the mud and brought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
it to a halt beside her. &#8220;If you&#8217;d shake hands
on that, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;d be mighty tickled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her hand went out to him. He took it and
pressed it warmly, looking at it, marveling at it,
for the glove on it could not conceal its shapeliness
or its smallness. He dropped it presently,
and taking off his hat, bowed to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be seein&#8217;
you ag&#8217;in some time. I hope you&#8217;ll like it here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I shall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He grinned and turned away. Her voice
halted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I know who has been so kind to us in
our trouble?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He reddened to the roots of his hair, but
faced her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I reckon you&#8217;ll know, ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;m
King Randerson, foreman of the Diamond H,
up the crick a ways. That is,&#8221; he added, his
blush deepening, &#8220;I was christened &#8216;King.&#8217; But
a while ago a dago professor who stayed overnight
at the Diamond H tipped the boys off that
&#8216;King&#8217; was Rex in Latin lingo. An&#8217; so it&#8217;s been
Rex Randerson since then, though mostly they
write it &#8216;<i>W-r-e-c-k-s</i>.&#8217; There&#8217;s no accountin&#8217; for
notions hereabouts, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I should think not!&#8221; said the lady,
making mental note of the blueness of his eyes.
&#8220;But I am sure the boys make a mistake in spelling
your name. Judging from your recent actions
it should be spelled &#8216;<i>R-e-c-k-l-e-s-s</i>.&#8217; Anyway,
we thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same to you, ma&#8217;am. So long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He flashed a smile at Aunt Martha; it broadened
as he met Uncle Jepson&#8217;s eyes; it turned to a
grin of derision as he looked at Masten. And
then he was splashing his pony across the river.
</p>
<p>They watched him as he rode up the slope on
the opposite side; they held their breath as pony
and rider climbed the steeper slope to the mesa.
They saw him halt when he reached the mesa, saw
him wave his hat to them. But they did not see
him halt the pony after he had ridden a little
way, and kiss the palm of the hand that had
held hers.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AT THE FLYING W</h3>
</div>

<p>It fell to Uncle Jepson to hitch the blacks to
the buckboard&mdash;in a frigid silence Masten
had found his trunk, opened it and drawn out
some very necessary dry clothing; then marching
behind a thick clump of alder, he proceeded to
make the change. After this he climbed down to
the river and washed the mud from visible portions
of his body. Then he returned to the buckboard,
to find the others waiting for him. In a
strained silence he climbed up to the seat beside
Ruth, took up the reins, and sent the blacks
forward.
</p>
<p>It was ten miles to the Flying W ranchhouse,
and during the ride the silence was broken only
once. That was when, at about the fifth mile,
Ruth placed a hand on Masten&#8217;s arm and smiled
at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think Mr. Randerson <i>was</i> sorry that
he upset you in the mud, Willard,&#8221; she said gently.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he did it to be mean. And it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
so manly of him to apologize to you.&#8221; She
laughed, thinking that time had already removed
the sting. &#8220;And you really <i>did</i> look funny,
Willard, with the mud all over you. I&mdash;I
could have laughed, myself, if I hadn&#8217;t felt so
indignant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll thank you to not refer to it again, Ruth,&#8221;
he said crossly.
</p>
<p>She flushed and looked straight ahead of her
at the unfolding vistas that their passage revealed:
at the undulating plains, green with bunch-grass
that the rain of the night before had washed and
reinvigorated; into gullies where weeds grew
thick; peering into arroyos&mdash;visible memories
of washouts and cloudbursts; glimpsing barrancas
as they flashed by; wondering at the depth of
draws through which the trail led; shivering at
the cacti&mdash;a brilliant green after the rain&mdash;for
somehow they seemed to symbolize the spirit
of the country&mdash;they looked so grim, hardy,
and mysterious with their ugly thorns that seemed
to threaten and mock. She shrank, too, when
the buckboard passed the skeleton of a steer, its
bleached bones ghastly in the sunlight, but she
smiled when she saw a sea of soap-weed with
yellow blossoms already unfolding, and she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
looked long at a mile-wide section of mesquite,
dark and inviting in the distance. She saw a
rattler cross the trail in front of the buckboard
and draw its loathsome length into a coil at the
base of some crabbed yucca, and thereafter she
made grimaces at each of the ugly plants they
passed. It was new to her, and wonderful.
Everything, weird or ugly, possessed a strange
fascination for her, and when they lurched over
the crest of a hill and she saw, looming somberly
in the distance in front of her, a great cottonwood
grove, with some mountains behind it, their peaks
gleaming in the shimmering sunlight, thrusting
above some fleecy white clouds against a background
of deep-blue sky, her eyes glistened and she
sat very erect, thrilled. It was in such a country
that she had longed to live all the days of her life.
</p>
<p>Somehow, it gave her a different viewpoint.
The man who had accommodated them back at
the river seemed to fit very well here. The
spirit of the young, unfettered country was in his
eyes, in his serene manner; he was as hardy and
rugged as this land from which he had sprung.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When the buckboard came to a halt in the
Flying W ranchhouse yard, Ruth Harkness&#8217; first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
emotion was one of a great happiness that the
Harknesses had always been thrifty and neat,
and also that Uncle William had persisted in
these habits. She had greatly feared, for during
the last day of her ride on the train she had
passed many ranchhouses and she had been
appalled and depressed by the dilapidated appearance
of their exteriors, and by the general
atmosphere of disorder and shiftlessness that
seemed to surround them. So many of them had
reminded her of the dwelling places of careless
farmers on her own familiar countryside, and
she had assured herself that if the Flying W
were anything like those others she would immediately
try to find a buyer, much as she wished
to stay.
</p>
<p>But the first glance at the Flying W convinced
her that her fears had been groundless. The
ranchhouse was a big two-story structure built
of heavy timber, with porches in front and rear,
and wide cornices, all painted white and set on
a solid foundation of stone. It looked spacious
and comfortable. The other buildings&mdash;stables,
bunkhouse, messhouse, blacksmith shop, and
several others&mdash;did not discredit the ranchhouse.
They all were in good repair. She had already
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
noted that the fences were well kept; she had seen
chickens and pigs, flowers and a small garden;
and behind the stable, in an enclosure of barbed
wire, she had observed some cows&mdash;milkers, she
was certain.
</p>
<p>The ranchhouse was well sheltered by timber.
The great cottonwood grove that she had seen
from the plains was close to the house on the
south; it extended east and west for perhaps half
a mile, and a grove of firs rose to the north, back
of the pasture fence. The general character of
the land surrounding the house was a sort of
rolling level. The foothills belonging to the
mountains that she had seen while approaching
the ranchhouse were behind the cottonwood
grove. She had seen, too, that the river they
had crossed at the ford which Wes Vickers had
called &#8220;Calamity&#8221; was not more than a mile
from the house, and therefore she concluded that
it doubled widely. Later, she learned from
Vickers that her conclusion was correct, and that
the river was called &#8220;Rabbit Ear.&#8221; Why it was
called that she was never able to discover.
</p>
<p>When the buckboard came to a halt, two men
who had been seated in the doorway of one of the
buildings&mdash;she discovered, later, that it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
the bunkhouse&mdash;got up, lazily, and approached
the buckboard. Ruth felt a pulse of trepidation
as they sauntered close to the wagon. Vickers
had told her nothing directly concerning the
character of the men at the ranch, but during
their conversation at Red Rock that morning he
had mentioned that the &#8220;boys are a good lot,
taken together, but they&#8217;s some that don&#8217;t measure
up.&#8221; And she wondered whether these two
came under that final vague, though significant
classification.
</p>
<p>Their appearance was against them. The
one in advance, a man of medium height, looked
positively villainous with his long, drooping black
mustache and heavy-thatched eyebrows. He
eyed the occupants of the buckboard with an
insolent half-smile, which the girl thought he
tried&mdash;in vain&mdash;to make welcoming.
</p>
<p>The other was a man of about thirty; tall,
slender, lithe, swarthy, with thin, expressive lips
that were twisted upward at one corner in an
insincere smirk. This taller man came close to
the wagon and paused in an attitude of quiet
impudence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re Ruth Harkness&mdash;the ol&#8217;
man&#8217;s niece?&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the girl, smiling. Perhaps
she had misjudged these men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the man, looking at her with a
bold glance that made her pulse skip a beat,
&#8220;you&#8217;re a stunner for looks, anyway.&#8221; He
reached out his hand. She took it, feeling that it
was the proper thing to do, although with the
action she heard a grumble from Masten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to the Flyin&#8217; W,&#8221; said the
man, breaking an awkward silence. &#8220;Tom
Chavis is special glad to see a pretty woman
around these parts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She felt, in his eyes more than his words, a
veiled significance. She reddened a little, but
met his gaze fairly, her eyes unwavering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Tom Chavis?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m reckonin&#8217; to be Tom Chavis,&#8221; he said,
studying her. He waved a hand toward the
other man, not looking at him. &#8220;This is my
friend Jim Pickett. We was foreman an&#8217; straw
boss, respective, under Bill Harkness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She could not help wishing that her uncle had
discharged the two men before his death. She
was wondering a little at Masten&#8217;s silence; it
seemed to her that he must see her embarrassment,
and that he might relieve her of the burden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
of this conversation. She looked quickly at him;
he appeared to be unconcernedly inspecting the
ranchhouse. Perhaps, after all, there was nothing
wrong with these men. Certainly, being a man
himself, Masten should be able to tell.
</p>
<p>And so she felt a little more at ease.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to meet you, Mr. Chavis,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Your friend Mr. Pickett too.&#8221; She indicated
Masten with a nod of her head toward him.
&#8220;This is Mr. Willard Masten, a very dear friend
of mine.&#8221; The color in her face deepened with
the words.
</p>
<p>Chavis had looked twice at Masten before
Ruth spoke. He looked again now, meeting the
Easterner&#8217;s eyes. Chavis had been ready to
sneer at Masten because of his garments&mdash;they
were duplicates of those he had worn before the
ducking, and quite as immaculate&mdash;but something
in the Easterner&#8217;s eyes kept the sneer back;
his own eyes gleamed with a quick, comprehensive
fire, and he smiled. In the buckboard, fresh from
that civilization which Chavis was ready to scorn,
he had recognized a kindred spirit. There was
exultation in his voice when he spoke, and he
reached over Ruth to grasp Masten&#8217;s hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; so this is Willard, a very dear friend of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
yourn, eh? Well, now, I&#8217;m sure glad, an&#8217; I
reckon him an&#8217; me will get on.&#8221; He urged
Pickett forward and introduced him, and Pickett
gave Masten one quick, appraising glance. Then
he, too, grinned.
</p>
<p>Ruth was gratified. These men were rough,
but they had been quick to recognize and appreciate
Masten&#8217;s good qualities. They had gone
more than half way in welcoming him. Of course,
there was Chavis&#8217; bold allusion to a &#8220;pretty
woman,&#8221; but the very uncouthness of the men
must be the explanation for that breach of
etiquette. She was much relieved.
</p>
<p>Masten was suave and solicitous. He jumped
out of the buckboard and helped her down, performing
a like service for Aunt Martha. Uncle
Jepson got out himself. Then, as Ruth hesitated
an instant, Masten bent over her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be tired, dear. Go in and explore
the house. Get some refreshment and take a
rest. I&#8217;ll attend to the baggage and the horses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gave her a gentle pressure of the hand,
and, followed by Uncle Jepson and Aunt Martha,
she went indoors.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A MEMORY OF THE RIDER</h3>
</div>

<p>A quiet satisfaction shone from Ruth&#8217;s
eyes when, accompanied by Aunt Martha
and Uncle Jepson, she completed her inspection
of the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t all that could be desired,&#8221; she told
Aunt Martha, &#8220;but it is better than I expected.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s comfortable, dearie,&#8221; mildly smiled
Aunt Martha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; big enough for a feller to stretch his legs
in,&#8221; added Uncle Jepson. He was sitting in a
big chair at one of the front windows of the
sitting-room, having already adjusted himself to
his new surroundings, and was smoking a short
briar pipe and looking out of the window at the
bunkhouse, in front of which stood Pickett,
Chavis, and Masten, talking and laughing.
</p>
<p>While Ruth and her relatives had been inspecting
one of the upstairs rooms, she had heard the
men bringing the baggage in, had heard them
clumping up the stairs and setting the trunks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
down. Then they went out, and a little later,
peering from one of the windows upstairs, Ruth
had seen Masten and the other two walking
toward the stable. They were talking pleasantly;
their liking for each other seemed to be mutual.
Ruth was delighted, but Uncle Jepson had
frowned several times when looking at them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cal&#8217;late them two critters&#8217;ll bear a heap of
watchin&#8217;,&#8221; he said now. &#8220;They don&#8217;t look
honest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jep,&#8221; said Aunt Martha before Ruth could
speak, &#8220;you&#8217;re always criticising folks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in their faces drat &#8217;em,&#8221; insisted Uncle
Jepson. He turned a vindictive eye on his niece.
&#8220;If I&#8217;d have been fifty year younger I&#8217;d have
give that Chavis a durn good thrashin&#8217; for sayin&#8217;
what he did to you about pretty gals. Durn his
hide, anyhow! That there Wil&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt that way myself, at first,&#8221; smiled Ruth.
&#8220;Afterwards, though, I felt differently. I suppose
they were glad to see the new owner. Perhaps
they haven&#8217;t seen a lady in a long time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s ways of showin&#8217; gladness,&#8221; contended
Uncle Jepson. &#8220;I cal&#8217;late if I wanted to compliment
a girl, I wouldn&#8217;t look at her like I wanted
to carry her off to the mountains.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jep, they&#8217;re only cowboys&mdash;they don&#8217;t know
any different,&#8221; remonstrated Aunt Martha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t, eh?&#8221; sniffed Uncle Jepson. &#8220;I
cal&#8217;late that feller, Rex Randerson, is some different,
ain&#8217;t he? There&#8217;s a gentleman, Ruth.
You didn&#8217;t see him makin&#8217; no ox-eyes. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll
bet you wouldn&#8217;t ketch him gettin&#8217; thick with them
two plug-uglies out there!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth turned away, smiling tolerantly, after
having caught a glimpse of Aunt Martha&#8217;s brows,
uplifted in resignation. She was as fully aware
of Uncle Jepson&#8217;s dislike of Willard Masten as
she was of Uncle Jepson&#8217;s testiness and of his
habit of speaking his thoughts without reservation.
</p>
<p>Also, she had always avoided opposing him.
It did not seem to be worth while. He had
been left destitute, except for the little farm back
near Poughkeepsie which he had sold at her
request to accompany her here, and she felt that
habits of thought and speech are firmly fixed at
sixty-nine, and argument cannot shake them.
</p>
<p>That first day at the ranchhouse was the
beginning of a new existence for Ruth. Bound
for years by the narrow restrictions and conventionality
of the Poughkeepsie countryside, she
found the spaciousness and newness of this life
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
inviting and satisfying. Here there seemed to be
no limit, either to the space or to the flights that
one&#8217;s soul might take, and in the solemn grandeur
of the open she felt the omnipotence of God and
the spell of nature.
</p>
<p>She had plenty of time after the first day to
hold communion with the Creator. Masten was
rarely near her. His acquaintance with Pickett
and Chavis seemed destined to develop into
friendship. He rode much with them&mdash;&#8220;looking
over the range,&#8221; he told her&mdash;and only in the
evening did he find time to devote to her.
</p>
<p>Wes Vickers returned from Red Rock on the
morning following Ruth&#8217;s arrival. Apparently,
in spite of Randerson&#8217;s prediction, Vickers did
not get drunk in town. Through him Ruth
learned much about the Flying W. He gave her
the fruit of his experience, and he had been with
the Flying W as range boss for nearly five
years.
</p>
<p>Vickers was forty. His hair was gray at the
temples; he was slightly stoop-shouldered from
years in the saddle, and his legs were bowed
from the same cause. He was the driving force
of the Flying W. Ruth&#8217;s uncle had written her
to that effect the year before during his illness,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
stating that without Vickers&#8217; help he would be
compelled to sell the ranch. The truth of this
statement dawned upon Ruth very soon after her
acquaintance with Vickers. He was argus-eyed,
omnipresent. It seemed that he never slept.
Mornings when she would arise with the dawn
she would find Vickers gone to visit some distant
part of the range. She was seldom awake at
night when he returned.
</p>
<p>He had said little to her regarding the men.
&#8220;They &#8217;tend to business,&#8221; was his invariable
response when she sought to question him. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a pretty wild life,&#8221; he told her when one day about
two weeks after her coming she had pressed him;
&#8220;an&#8217; the boys just can&#8217;t help kickin&#8217; over the
traces once in a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chavis and Pickett good men?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw anything to show you they ain&#8217;t?&#8221;
he said, with a queer look at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; she returned. But her cheeks
reddened.
</p>
<p>He looked at her with a peculiar squint.
&#8220;Seems like Masten runnin&#8217; with them shows that
they ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; wrong with them,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>She had no reply to make to this, but she was
vaguely disturbed over the expression in Vickers&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
eyes; that look seemed to indicate that her own
first impression of the two men, and Uncle
Jepson&#8217;s later condemnation of them, might be
correct. However, they did not bother her, and
she felt certain that Masten could care for
himself.
</p>
<p>With Masten absent with Chavis and Pickett
nearly every day, Ruth had much time to herself.
The river attracted her, and she rode to it many
times, on a slant-eyed pony that Vickers had
selected for her, and which had been gentled by
a young cowpuncher brought in from an outlying
camp solely for that purpose by the range boss.
The young puncher had been reluctant to come,
and he was equally reluctant to go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This here cayuse,&#8221; he said to Vickers, when
the latter instructed him to return to his outfit,
saying that Miss Ruth thought she could now
ride the pony without trouble, &#8220;is got a heap of
devilment in him, yet&mdash;which ought to come
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ruth&#8217;s got a fellow,&#8221; said the range
boss, in seeming irrelevance. But the young
puncher sneered a malignant denial and rode
away to his camp.
</p>
<p>There were fourteen other men employed by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
the Flying W. Ruth met them at various times.
Invariably they were looking for strays. They
seemed&mdash;some of them&mdash;content to look at
her; others, bolder, manufactured ingenuous pretexts
to talk; but&mdash;all were gentlemen.
</p>
<p>She arose one morning during the third week
of her stay at the ranch, to be greeted by one of
those perfect days that late spring brings. It
had been dry for a week, with a hint of receding
chill in the air, and the comfort of a wrap was
still felt. But on this morning the sun was showing
his power, and a balmy south breeze that
entered her window was burdened with the aroma
of sage, strong and delicious. She got out of
bed and looked out of the window. It was a
changed world. Summer had come overnight.
No morning in the East had ever made her feel
quite like this.
</p>
<p>Out on the front porch later in the morning,
with Chavis and Pickett standing near, she asked
Masten to ride with her.
</p>
<p>He seemed annoyed, but spoke persuasively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it off a day, won&#8217;t you, Ruth? There&#8217;s a
good girl. I&#8217;ve promised to go to Lazette with
the boys this morning, and I don&#8217;t want to disappoint
them.&#8221; Then, seeing the disappointment in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
her eyes, he added: &#8220;Where did you want to
ride?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, hoping that, after all, he
might change his mind, &#8220;I&#8217;m only going to the box
canyon, down the river. There&#8217;s such a pretty
stretch of timber there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He smiled indulgently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to meet you
there, this afternoon about three, if I can make it.
But don&#8217;t wait longer.&#8221; He turned his back to
her and presently went away with Chavis and
Pickett.
</p>
<p>She stood for a little time, watching them as
they mounted down near the corral gate and rode
away, and then she turned and observed Uncle
Jepson standing near a corner of the house, smoking,
and watching her. She forced a smile and
went into the house.
</p>
<p>A little after noon she saddled her pony and
rode away toward the river. She had decided that
perhaps Masten might keep his appointment in
spite of the obvious insincerity that had been expressed
on his face during their talk.
</p>
<p>It was fully five miles to the grove at the head
of the box canyon, and she made a leisurely ride
of it, so that it must have been nearly two o&#8217;clock
when she dismounted and hitched the pony to a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
tree. Seating herself on a flat rock near the canyon
edge, she settled herself to wait.
</p>
<p>It seemed a long time. Twice after half-past
two she looked at her watch, impatiently. At
three she looked again; and, disappointed, she
was about to rise to go to her pony, when she
heard the rapid drumming of hoofs near her.
</p>
<p>With leaping heart and flushed face she turned
her back to the direction from which the sounds
seemed to come and waited listening, trying to appear
unconcerned. She would make him believe
she had not heard him. He did care, after all,
enough to part with his companions&mdash;for her
sake. She had misjudged him, and she was sincerely
repentant. And when she heard his pony
come to a halt near her she had to clench her
hands to keep from turning to face him.
</p>
<p>She heard him dismount, heard the rustle and
crackling of twigs under his feet as he approached,
and then, feeling that it would be futile to dissemble
further, she turned, a smile on her lips.
</p>
<p>Standing within five feet of her, grinning with
amusement, was Tom Chavis. Curiously enough,
despite her former fear of the man she did not
fear him now, and after the first shock of surprise
she looked at him composedly, for she half suspected
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
that Masten had sent him, fearing that she
<i>would</i> wait in spite of his admonition not to do so.
She got up and faced Chavis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Masten couldn&#8217;t come, I suppose?&#8221; she
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said, looking at her oddly;
&#8220;he couldn&#8217;t come. You see, he&#8217;s sort of taken a
shine to a biscuit shooter in Crogan&#8217;s, over in
Lazette, an&#8217; he couldn&#8217;t very well break away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A biscuit shooter!&#8221; she said, uncomprehendingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I reckon that back East you&#8217;d call her
a waitress, or somethin&#8217;. I ain&#8217;t admirin&#8217; his taste
none. She ain&#8217;t nowheres near as good-lookin&#8217; as
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her first emotion was one of sickening, maddening
jealousy. It made her physically weak,
and she trembled as she fought it down. But the
sensation passed and, though she felt that her
face was hot and flushed, the cold calm of righteous
resentment was slowly seizing her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Masten send you here to tell me
this?&#8221; she asked icily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no. I did it on my own hook. I
knowed you&#8217;d be waitin&#8217;&mdash;I heard you makin&#8217; the
date with Willard, this mornin&#8217;. An&#8217; I figgered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
that what was fair for one was fair for another.
So I sneaked away from Willard an&#8217; come here.
I&#8217;ve taken quite a shine to you, ma&#8217;am; you&#8217;ve sure
got me some flustered. An&#8217; I reckon&mdash;&#8221; here he
took a step toward her and grinned significantly
&#8220;that I&#8217;ll make a rattlin&#8217; good substitute for
Willard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She struck at him, blindly, savagely. She felt
her open hand strike his cheek, heard him curse,
and then, in a daze she was running toward her
pony. She did not turn, but furiously raced the
animal across the plains toward the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>She was calmer when she reached the house, but
went directly to her room, where she changed her
clothes and sat for a long time at one of the windows,
looking toward the river&mdash;and toward
Lazette.
</p>
<p>Downstairs, Uncle Jepson, who from a window
of the bunkhouse had seen her come in, had followed
her into the house, to remark grumblingly
to Aunt Martha:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Willard didn&#8217;t meet her, drat him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth passed a miserable night, thinking over
Chavis&#8217; words. The man might have been lying.
Obviously, common fairness demanded that she
tell Masten of the circumstance. On one thing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
she was determined: that Chavis should leave
the ranch, whether he had lied to her or not. She
would have instructed Vickers to attend to that,
but Vickers had gone again to Red Rock on business,
and would not return for two or three days.
She would wait until Vickers returned to discharge
Chavis, but she must tell Masten of the insult, for
she yearned to see Chavis punished.
</p>
<p>She waited until after breakfast the following
morning, and then she induced Masten to walk
with her, under pretext of examining the flower
beds. Reaching them, she faced him fairly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Willard,&#8221; she said, her lips white and stiff,
&#8220;there must be no double-dealing between you and
me. Tom Chavis told me yesterday that you are
interested in a waitress in Lazette. Is that true?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He started, flushed darkly, and then smiled
blandly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Chavis is romancing, my dear. If there
is a waitress in Lazette I have not seen her.&#8221; He
seized her by the shoulders and spoke earnestly.
&#8220;I am interested in Ruth Harkness, my dear.
You surely don&#8217;t believe such a story, do you,
Ruth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at her so frankly that her jealousy
took wings, and she blushed and lowered her eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
She raised them again, almost instantly, however;
they were glowing vindictively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Chavis came to the box canyon at three
yesterday afternoon,&#8221; she said firmly. &#8220;He insulted
me. I want you to discharge him; Vickers
is not here to do it. And I do not want to see him
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He pressed his lips together and avoided her
gaze, and a slow red stole into his face. Then he
laughed mirthlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Chavis is a valuable man here, Ruth,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If the insult was one that can be overlooked,
you would do well to let the matter rest.
But be assured that I shall have a talk with Chavis,
and you may believe that he will not repeat the offense.&#8221;
He patted her shoulder. &#8220;In the meantime,&#8221;
he said, with a hurt expression in his eyes,
&#8220;do have some faith in me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reassured, convinced that she had done him an
injustice in believing Chavis, she passed the remainder
of the day in comparative light-heartedness.
But when the awesome darkness of the
West settled over the country, and deep, stirring
thoughts came to her on her pillow, she found herself
thinking of the rider of the river. He grew
very vivid in her thoughts, and she found herself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
wondering,&mdash;remembering the stern manliness
of his face,&mdash;whether he, listening to the
story of Chavis&#8217; insult from her lips, would have
sought to find excuses for her insulter.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>LOVE VS. BUSINESS</h3>
</div>

<p>On Sunday afternoon Ruth, Masten, Aunt
Martha, and Uncle Jepson were sitting
on the front porch of the Flying W ranchhouse.
Ruth was reading and thinking&mdash;thinking
most of the time, the book lying open in her
lap. Masten was smoking a cigar&mdash;one of the
many that he had brought with him&mdash;and which
he selfishly kept exclusively for his own use.
Masten seemed to be doing a great deal of thinking,
too, for he was silent during long periods, reclining
easily in a big rocker, well-groomed and
immaculate as usual, looking decidedly out of place
in this country, where extravagant personal
adornment was considered an indication of effeminacy.
</p>
<p>Yet it was this immaculateness that had attracted
Ruth to Masten in the first place when a year
and a half before she had met him at a party in
Poughkeepsie. Fresh from a big city near by, he
had outshone the country gallants at the party as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
he had outshone the cowboys that Ruth had seen
since coming to the Flying W. His courtship had
been gallant, too; he had quite captivated her, and
after their engagement&mdash;which had been a rather
matter-of-fact affair&mdash;she had not found it possible
to refuse him permission to accompany her
to the West.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you visited your neighbor yet, Ruth?&#8221;
Masten inquired at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neighbor!&#8221; Ruth showed astonishment by
letting her book close and losing her place.
&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t know we had a neighbor nearer
than the Diamond H!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten&#8217;s lips curled. Her reference to the
Diamond H recalled unpleasant memories.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A nester,&#8221; he said, and then added after a
pause&mdash;&#8220;and his daughter. Only two miles
from here, across the river. There&#8217;s a trail,
through a break in the canyon, leading to their
ranch on the other side of the river. The man&#8217;s
name is Catherson&mdash;Abe Catherson. Chavis
tells me he was something of a bother to your
uncle, because of his propensity to steal Flying W
cattle. He&#8217;s an old savage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the daughter?&#8221; inquired Ruth, her eyes
alight with interest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Half wild, bare-footed, ragged. She&#8217;s pretty,
though.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How old is she, Willard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A mere child. Fifteen, I should judge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall visit them tomorrow,&#8221; declared Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sakes alive! Half wild? I should think she
would be&mdash;living in that wilderness!&#8221; said Aunt
Martha, looking up from her knitting, over the
tops of her glasses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is wild in this country,&#8221; said
Masten, a slight sneer in his voice. &#8220;The people
are repulsive, in dress, manner, and speech.&#8221; He
delicately flecked some cigar ash from a coat
sleeve.
</p>
<p>Uncle Jepson wrinkled his nose belligerently.
He sniffed in eloquent preparation for speech, but
Aunt Martha averted the imminent clash by saying
sharply:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jep, you hop in there and get that ball of yarn
off the dining-room table!&#8221;
</p>
<p>So potent is habit that Uncle Jepson started to
obey automatically, Ruth interjected a word,
speaking to Masten, and Uncle Jepson&#8217;s opportunity
was lost.
</p>
<p>Silence reigned again until Ruth, who was
facing the Calamity Trail, suddenly exclaimed:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some one is coming!&#8221;
</p>
<p>During the silence she had again been thinking
of Rex Randerson, and seeing the figure on the
trail she had leaped to the conclusion that it was
he. Her face had flushed. Masten noticed it, for
he looked narrowly at her and, though he said
nothing, there was that in his eyes which told he
had divined what was in her mind.
</p>
<p>It was not Randerson, however, but Vickers,
who was coming. They all recognized him when
he came closer, and they watched him with that
peculiar concertedness which seizes upon an expectant
company, until he dismounted at the corral
gates and came toward them.
</p>
<p>Plainly there was something on Vickers&#8217; mind,
for he smiled mechanically as he stepped upon the
porch and looked at them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m back,&#8221; he said. He looked at Ruth.
&#8220;There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; I&#8217;d like to say to you. It&#8217;s
business. If you&#8217;d rather hear it private&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is nothing&mdash;&#8221; she began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to leave here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s face grew long. Uncle Jepson gagged
on a mouthful of smoke. Aunt Martha ceased
knitting. Masten alone seemed unmoved, but an
elated gleam was in his eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a rather sudden decision, Mr. Vickers?&#8221;
questioned Ruth after a silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, mebbe it is, to you,&#8221; said Vickers, with
some embarrassment. &#8220;But the fact is, I&#8217;ve been
thinkin&#8217; of goin&#8217; for a long time&mdash;about a year
to be exact. I was goin&#8217; before your uncle died,
but I kept holdin&#8217; on because he wanted me to.
You see, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;ve got a mother back East.
She&#8217;s been poorly for quite a while now, an&#8217; has
been wantin&#8217; me to come. I&#8217;ve been puttin&#8217; it off,
but it&#8217;s got to the point where it can&#8217;t be put off
any longer. I got a letter from her doctor the
other day, an&#8217; he says that she can&#8217;t last a heap
longer. So&mdash;I&#8217;m goin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; sympathized Ruth. &#8220;You
ought to go, and go quickly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m aimin&#8217; to, ma&#8217;am. But I&#8217;ve got to tell
you somethin&#8217; before I go. Me an&#8217; your uncle was
pretty thick; he trusted me a heap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ruth; &#8220;he told me that he liked
and trusted you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll understand then. A couple of
months before he cashed in, we was talkin&#8217; of him
goin&#8217;. He knowed it, ma&#8217;am. We was talkin&#8217;
about the ranch. He knowed I wanted to leave.
&#8216;What&#8217;ll I do for a range boss when you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
gone?&#8217; he asked me. &#8216;I won&#8217;t go till you ain&#8217;t
here any more,&#8217; I tells him. An&#8217; he grinned. &#8216;I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to leave the Flyin&#8217; W to my niece, Ruth
Harkness of Poughkeepsie,&#8217; he says. &#8216;I&#8217;d like her
to stay an&#8217; run it&mdash;if she likes it here. You&#8217;ll
be gone then, an&#8217; who in Sam Hill will be range
boss then?&#8217; I told him I didn&#8217;t have no thoughts
on the subject, an&#8217; he continues: &#8216;Rex Randerson,
Vickers&mdash;he&#8217;ll be range boss. Do you understand?
If you was to pull your freight right
now, Rex Randerson would be range boss as soon
as I could get word over to him. An&#8217; if you&#8217;ve
got any say-so after I&#8217;m gone, an&#8217; Ruth wants to
keep the ranch, you tell her that&mdash;that Bill Harkness
wants Rex Randerson to be range boss after
Wes Vickers don&#8217;t want it any more.&#8217; That&#8217;s
what he said, ma&#8217;am; them&#8217;s his very words.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth looked at Masten. He was staring stonily
out into the plains. Ruth&#8217;s cheeks reddened,
for she felt that she knew his thoughts. But still,
Randerson hadn&#8217;t really used him ill at the river,
and besides, he had apologized, and it seemed to
her that that should end the incident. Also, she
still felt rather resentful toward Masten for his
attitude toward Tom Chavis after she had complained.
And also, lurking deep in her unsophisticated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
mind was a most feminine impulse to sting
Masten to jealousy. She looked up to meet
Vickers&#8217; gaze, fixed curiously upon her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you recommend this man&mdash;Randerson?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, ma&#8217;am, he&#8217;s got the best reputation of
any man in these parts!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But is he efficient?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; does he know his business? Well, I
reckon. He&#8217;s got the best head for range work of
any man in the country! He&#8217;s square, ma&#8217;am.
An&#8217; there ain&#8217;t no man monkeyin&#8217; with him. I&#8217;ve
knowed him for five years, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t ever knowed
him to do a crooked trick, exceptin&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;and here
he scratched his head and grinned reminiscently&mdash;&#8220;when
he gets the devil in him which he
does occasionally, ma&#8217;am&mdash;an&#8217; goes to jokin&#8217;,
ma&#8217;am. But they&#8217;re mostly harmless jokes,
ma&#8217;am; he&#8217;s never hurt nobody, bad. But
he got a level head&mdash;a heap leveler than a lot
of folks that&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Tom Chavis would make a good range
boss, Ruth,&#8221; said Masten. He did not look at
her, and his words were expressionless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister man,&#8221; said Vickers evenly, &#8220;what do
you know about Tom Chavis?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>Masten looked quickly at Vickers, and as
quickly looked away, his face slowly reddening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s foreman now, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
seems that Harkness trusted him that much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a first time for every man to go
wrong, Mister,&#8221; said Vickers.
</p>
<p>Masten&#8217;s voice was almost a sneer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you tell Chavis that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told him, Mister&mdash;to his face.&#8221; Vickers&#8217;
own face was growing dark with wrath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were range boss after Harkness&#8217; death,&#8221;
persisted Masten. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you discharge
Chavis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m askin&#8217; the new boss for permission to do
it now,&#8221; declared Vickers. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be a good wind-up
for my stay here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall keep Chavis for the present,&#8221; said
Ruth. &#8220;However,&#8221; she added firmly, &#8220;he shall
not be range boss. I do not like him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Vickers grinned silent applause. And again
Uncle Jepson had trouble with his pipe. Aunt
Martha worked her knitting needles a little faster.
Masten&#8217;s face paled, and the hand that held the
cigar quickly clenched, so that smoking embers fell
to the porch floor. Whatever his feelings, however,
he retained his self-control.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, it is your affair, Ruth,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I beg your pardon for offering the suggestion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he left them shortly afterward, lighting a
fresh cigar and walking toward the bunkhouse,
which was deserted, for Chavis and Pickett had
gone to a distant part of the range.
</p>
<p>Thus Masten did not see Vickers, when a little
later he came out on the porch with his war-bag.
He said good-bye to Aunt Martha and Uncle Jepson,
and then he took Ruth&#8217;s hand and held it
long.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never go a heap wrong when you use
your own judgment, girl,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m ridin&#8217;
over to the Diamond H to tell Randerson about
his new job. Don&#8217;t make no mistake, girl. Rex
Randerson is square. An&#8217; if any trouble comes
sneakin&#8217; around you, take it to Rex; he&#8217;ll stick on
the right side till hell freezes over.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A MAN AND HIS JOB</h3>
</div>

<p>Just what Ruth&#8217;s sensations were the next
morning she could not have told. She could
correctly analyze one emotion: it was eager anticipation.
Also, she could account for it&mdash;she
wanted to see Randerson. But her reason for
wanting to see him was a mystery that she could
not fathom, though between the time of arising
and the moment when she got downstairs she devoted
much thought to it. She knew she did not
like Randerson well enough to wish to see him
merely on that account&mdash;that was ridiculous, in
spite of the vivid recollection of him that still
lingered with her, for she had met him only once,
and she assured herself that she was too practical-minded
to fall in love with anyone at first sight.
Yet by afternoon Ruth had tired of waiting; she
had no special reason for certainty that Randerson
would arrive that day, and so she went riding.
She went alone, for Masten seemed to have hidden
himself&mdash;at least, she could not find him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
She rode to the break in the wall of the canyon
that he had told her about, found it, sent her pony
through it and over a shallow crossing, emerging
at length in a tangle of undergrowth in a wood
through which wound a narrow bridle path. She
followed this for some distance, and after a while
came to a clearing. A little adobe house stood
near the center of the clearing. Ruth halted her
pony, and was debating whether to call out or to
ride boldly up, when a dog came out of the door
of the cabin, growling, its hair bristling belligerently.
The dog was big, black, and undoubtedly
savage, for the pony instantly wheeled, and when
the dog came closer, lashed out with both hind
hoofs at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nig, you ol&#8217; duffer, git in hyeh where you
b&#8217;long! Can&#8217;t you see that that there&#8217;s a <i>lady!</i>&#8221;
came a voice, unmistakably feminine. And the
dog, still growling, but submissive, drew off.
</p>
<p>Ruth urged the pony on and rode the remaining
distance to the door. A girl, attired in a ragged underskirt
and equally ragged waist of some checkered
material, and a faded house-apron that was
many sizes too small for her, stood in the open
doorway, watching. She was bare-footed, her
hair was in tumbling disorder, though Ruth could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
tell that it had been combed recently. But the legs,
bare almost to the knees, were clean, though
brown from tan, and her face and arms glowed
pink and spotless, in spite of the rags. In her
eyes, as she watched Ruth, was a strange mixture
of admiration and defiance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad ain&#8217;t hyeh this mornin&#8217;,&#8221; she volunteered
as Ruth climbed off her pony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to see you,&#8221; said Ruth, smiling. She
threw the reins over the pony&#8217;s head and advanced,
holding out a hand. &#8220;I am Ruth Harkness,&#8221;
she added, &#8220;the new owner of the Flying
W. I have been here almost a month, and I just
heard that I had a neighbor. Wont you shake
hands with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; said the girl. Reluctantly, it
seemed, she allowed Ruth to take her hand. But
she drew it away immediately. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of
you,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you&#8217;re a niece of that ol&#8217; devil,
Bill Harkness.&#8221; She frowned. &#8220;He was always
sayin&#8217; dad was hookin&#8217; his doggoned cattle. Dad
didn&#8217;t steal &#8217;em&mdash;ol&#8217; Bill Harkness was a liar!&#8221;
Her eyes glowed fiercely. &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ll be
sayin&#8217; the same thing about dad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No indeed!&#8221; declared Ruth. &#8220;Your dad
and I are going to be friends. I want to be friends
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
with you, too. I am not going to charge your dad
with stealing my cattle. We are going to be neighbors,
and visit each other. I want to know your
dad, and I want you to come over to the Flying
W and get acquainted with my aunt and uncle.
Aren&#8217;t you going to invite me inside? I would if
you came to visit me, you know.&#8221; She smiled
winningly.
</p>
<p>The girl flushed, and cast a glance at the interior
of the cabin, which, Ruth had already noted
through the open door, was scantily furnished but
clean. Then the girl led the way in, motioned
Ruth to a chair near a rough-topped table, and
stood over beside a cast-iron stove, her hands
hanging at her sides, the fingers crumpling the
cloth of the ragged apron. Her belligerence had
departed; she seemed now to be beginning to
realize that this visit was really meant to honor
her, and she grew conscious of her rags, of the
visible signs of poverty, of the visitor&#8217;s raiment,
gorgeous in comparison with her own&mdash;though
Ruth&#8217;s was merely a simple riding habit of brown
corduroy.
</p>
<p>Ruth had set out for this visit with a definite
intention: she wanted to discover just how the
girl and her father lived, and if conditions were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
as she suspected she was determined to help them.
Conditions were worse than she had expected, but
her face gave no indication. Perhaps Ruth&#8217;s wisdom
was not remarkable where men were concerned,
but she had a wealth of delicacy, understanding
and sympathy where her own sex was
in question. She stayed at the cabin for more
than an hour and at the end of that time she
emerged, smiling happily, her arm around the
girl, with the girl&#8217;s pledge to visit her soon and
an earnest invitation to come again. Best of all, she
had cleverly played upon the feminine instinct for
fine raiment, slyly mentioned a trunk that she had
brought with her from the East, packed to the
top with substantial finery which was not in the
least needed by her&mdash;an incumbrance, rather&mdash;and
which, she hinted, might become the property
of another, if suitable in size.
</p>
<p>The girl followed her to the edge of the clearing,
walking beside the pony. There they took
leave of each other, a glow in the eyes of both
that gave promise of future sincere friendship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Hagar,&#8221; said the Flying W girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, lady,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Ruth,&#8221; she
changed, as the Flying W girl held up an admonishing
finger. And then, with a last smile, Ruth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
rode down the bridle path homeward, pleasure
and pity mingling in her eyes.
</p>
<p>Randerson reached the Flying W ranchhouse
late in the afternoon. He rode first to the bunkhouse,
and seeing nobody there he made a round
of the buildings. Still seeing no one, he urged
Patches toward the house, halted him at the edge
of the front porch and sat in the saddle, looking
at the front door. He was about to call, when
the door opened and Uncle Jepson came out.
There was a broad grin on Uncle Jepson&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cal&#8217;late you&#8217;ve got here,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks mighty like it,&#8221; returned the horseman.
&#8220;You reckon my new boss is anywheres
around?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone off ridin&#8217;,&#8221; Uncle Jepson told him.
&#8220;It&#8217;s likely she&#8217;ll be back shortly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;d better wait,&#8221; said Randerson.
He wheeled Patches.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of sittin&#8217; room on the porch
here,&#8221; invited Uncle Jepson, indicating the chairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you&mdash;reckon the bunkhouse will be
my quarters.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke to the pony. Uncle Jepson spoke at
the same instant, and Patches halted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cal&#8217;late you&#8217;d better wait here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you insist,&#8221; said Randerson. He swung
off and walked to the edge of the porch, grinning
mildly at Uncle Jepson. The handclasp between
them was warm, for Uncle Jepson had been
strongly attracted to this son of the plains; and
the twinkle in Randerson&#8217;s eyes as his met Uncle
Jepson&#8217;s was not to be mistaken.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So Vickers has gone,&#8221; said Randerson as he
dropped into a chair. &#8220;He&#8217;s a mighty fine man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Willard wanted Chavis to have his job,&#8221;
whispered Uncle Jepson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; Randerson&#8217;s eyes gleamed.
&#8220;An&#8217; Miss Ruth didn&#8217;t want him, I reckon.&#8221; He
caught Uncle Jepson&#8217;s nod. &#8220;She&#8217;s allowin&#8217; that
she&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be boss. But of course she would,&#8221;
he added. He stood up, for Aunt Martha had
opened the door and was standing in it, looking
at him. He removed his hat and bowed to her,
his eyes gleaming with something near affection,
for Aunt Martha had found a place in his heart.
He stepped forward, took her hand, and escorted
her to the largest and most comfortable of the
rockers on the porch, and when she sat down she
looked up at him and smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you like it here?&#8221; he said gently to
Aunt Martha.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I like it very much. But there are differences&mdash;after
Poughkeepsie. One doesn&#8217;t notice them
so much at first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect you find it sort of rough here,&#8221; he
said, looking at her. &#8220;They tell me that in the
East folks live pretty close together&mdash;that there&#8217;s
conveniences. There ain&#8217;t a heap of conveniences
here.&#8221; He pronounced the word slowly and
laboriously. It was plain that he was trying to put
on his best manners.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no conveniences,&#8221; said Aunt Martha.
&#8220;But it&#8217;s a wonderful country, my boy&mdash;wonderful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A pulse of something shot through him at the
word, &#8220;boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like it,&#8221; he said gravely.
</p>
<p>Aunt Martha folded her hands in her lap and
looked long at him over the rims of her glasses.
There was interest in her eyes, and kindliness. For
she saw something in this figure of a new type that
sat before her&mdash;something that the two big guns,
at his hips did not hint at&mdash;nor his leather chaps,
the cartridge belt, the broad hat, the spurs, the
high-heeled boots, the colored scarf at his throat.
These things were the badges of his calling, and
were, of course, indispensable, but she saw them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
not. But the virile manhood of him; the indomitability;
the quiet fearlessness, indicated by his
steady, serene eyes; the rugged, sterling honesty
that radiated from him, she saw&mdash;and admired.
But above all she saw the boy in him&mdash;the
generous impulses that lay behind his mask of
grimness, the love of fun that she had seen him
exhibit at Calamity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were born here?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In Colfax, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a city?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless yu&#8217;, ma&#8217;am, no. It&#8217;s a county.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you were born on a ranch, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was asking questions that a man would not
have dared to ask him, and he was answering them
as a boy might have answered. It did not seem
an impertinence to him or to her, so great was
her interest in him, so deep was his admiration of
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And your parents?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Both dead, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; A shadow crossed his
face, a look of wistfulness, and she abruptly
ceased questioning. And when, a little later, they
saw Ruth coming across the plains toward them,
Aunt Martha got up. He held the screen door
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
open for her, and she paused on the threshold and
patted his bare head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had had a son, I could have wished he
would be like you,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>He blushed crimson. &#8220;Why, ma&#8217;am&mdash;&#8221; he
began. But Aunt Martha had gone in, and he
turned to face Ruth, who was dismounting at the
edge of the porch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, as though his appearance
had surprised her, though she had seen him from
afar, &#8220;you are here already!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect it&#8217;s me, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said gravely.
&#8220;You see, Wes Vickers stopped at the Diamond
H last evenin&#8217;, an&#8217; I come right over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was quite evident that he would not attempt
to be familiar. No longer was he the free lance
rider of the plains who had been at liberty to exchange
words with her as suited his whim; here
was the man who had been given a job, and there
stood his employer; he would not be likely to
step over that line, and his manner showed it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am glad you decided to
come right away; we miss Vickers already, and I
have no doubt, according to his recommendation,
that you will be able to fill his place acceptably.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, ma&#8217;am. I reckon I&#8217;m to take up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
my quarters in the bunkhouse?&#8221; He paused.
&#8220;Or mebbe the foreman&#8217;s shanty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, looking at him and noting
his grave earnestness, so strikingly in contrast to
his wild frolicksomeness at Calamity that day.
&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know about that. Vickers stayed
at the ranchhouse, and I suppose you will stay
here too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, ma&#8217;am; I&#8217;ll be takin&#8217; my war-bag
in.&#8221; He was evidently feeling a slight embarrassment,
and would have been glad to retreat.
He got his war-bag from its place behind
the saddle, on Patches, shouldered it, and crossed
the porch. He was opening the door when Ruth&#8217;s
voice stopped him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;your room. I forgot to tell
you; it is the one in the northwest corner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He went in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down when you have straightened
around,&#8221; she called to him, &#8220;I want to talk with
you about some things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to put Patches away, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;d sure have to come down, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That talk was held with Uncle Jepson looking
on and listening and smoking his pipe. And when
it was over, Randerson took the saddle and bridle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
off Patches, turned him loose in the corral and returned
to the porch to talk and smoke with Uncle
Jepson.
</p>
<p>While they sat the darkness came on,
the kerosene lamp inside was lighted, delicious
odors floated out to them through the screen door.
Presently a horseman rode to the corral fence and
dismounted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the boys, I reckon,&#8221; said Randerson.
</p>
<p>Uncle Jepson chuckled. &#8220;It&#8217;s Willard,&#8221; he
said. He peered into Randerson&#8217;s face for some
signs of emotion. There were none.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d clean forgot him,&#8221; said Randerson.
</p>
<p>Masten came in a few minutes later. He spoke
a few words to Uncle Jepson, but ignored
Randerson.
</p>
<p>Supper was announced soon after Masten&#8217;s
entrance, and Uncle Jepson led Randerson around
to the rear porch, where he introduced him to a
tin washbasin and a roller towel. Uncle Jepson
also partook of this luxury, and then led the new
range boss inside.
</p>
<p>If Ruth had any secret dread over the inevitable
meeting between Masten and the new range boss,
it must have been dispelled by Randerson&#8217;s manner,
for he was perfectly polite to Masten,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
and by no word or sign did he indicate that he
remembered the incident of Calamity.
</p>
<p>Ruth watched him covertly during the meal,
and was delighted to find his conduct faultless.
He had not Masten&#8217;s polish, of course, that was
not to be expected. But she noticed this&mdash;it was
quickly impressed upon her&mdash;he was not self-conscious,
but entirely natural, possessing the
easy grace of movement that comes of perfect
muscular and mental control. He seemed to
relegate self to the background; he was considerate,
quiet, serene. And last&mdash;the knowledge
pleased her more than anything else&mdash;he continued
to keep between himself and the others the
bars of deference; he made them see plainly
that there would be no overstepping his position.
It was his job to be here, and he had no illusions.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>HOW AN INSULT WAS AVENGED</h3>
</div>

<p>As the days passed, it became plain to Ruth,
as it did to everyone else on the ranch&mdash;Chavis,
Pickett, and Masten included&mdash;that
Vickers had not talked extravagantly in recommending
Randerson. Uncle Jepson declared that
&#8220;he took right a-hold,&#8221; and Aunt Martha beamed
proudly upon him whenever he came within range
of her vision.
</p>
<p>There was no hitch; he did his work smoothly.
The spring round-up was carried to a swift conclusion,
the calves were branded and turned loose
again to roam the range during the summer; the
corral fences were repaired, new irrigation ditches
were laid, others extended&mdash;the numerous details
received the attention they merited, and when
summer came in earnest, the Flying W was spick
and span and prospering.
</p>
<p>Chavis and Pickett still retained their old
positions, but Ruth noticed that they did not spend
so much of their time around the bunkhouse as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
formerly, they seemed to have work enough to
keep their time fully employed. Nor did Masten
accompany them very often. He seemed to take
a new interest in Ruth; he found various pretexts
to be near her, and Ruth secretly congratulated
herself on her wisdom in securing her new range
boss. She had scarcely expected such amazing results.
</p>
<p>She was conscious of a vague disappointment,
though. For she would have liked to see more of
her range boss. Twice, under pretense of wanting
to look over the property, she had accompanied
him to outlying cow camps, and she had noted
that the men seemed to like him&mdash;they called him
&#8220;Rex,&#8221; and in other ways exhibited their satisfaction
over his coming. Several times she
had observed meetings between him and Chavis
and Pickett; invariably Chavis was sullen and disagreeable
in his presence, and a number of times
she had seen Pickett sneer when Randerson&#8217;s back
was turned. No one had told her of the open
enmity that existed between Pickett and Randerson;
the latter had not hinted of it.
</p>
<p>And Randerson was at the ranchhouse even
less frequently than his predecessor; he spent
much of his time with the outfit. But he came in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
one afternoon, after Ruth&#8217;s friendship with
Hagar Catherson had progressed far, and met
the nester&#8217;s daughter on the porch as he was about
to enter the house.
</p>
<p>By ingenious artifice and persuasion Ruth had
induced the girl to accept for her own many of the
various garments in the alluring trunk, and Ruth
herself had been surprised at the wonderful
transformation in her appearance when arrayed
in them. Hagar was attired this afternoon in a dark-blue
riding habit, with short skirt&mdash;shortened by
Aunt Martha&mdash;riding boots, a waist with a low
collar and a flowing tie, and a soft hat that Ruth
had re-made for her. She had received lessons
in hair-dressing, and her brown, wavy tresses were
just obstinate enough, through long neglect, to refuse
to yield fully to the influence of comb and
brush; they bulged under the brim of the soft hat,
and some stray wisps persisted in blowing over her
face.
</p>
<p>She had just taken leave of Ruth who, at the
instant Randerson stepped on the porch, was
standing inside the doorway, watching her. She
had given the girl a trinket that had long been
coveted by her, and Hagar&#8217;s eyes were bright
with delight as she took leave of her friend. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
grew even brighter when she saw Randerson on
the porch, and a swift color suffused her face.
</p>
<p>The girl stood still, looking at the range boss.
A sudden whim to discover if he recognized her,
took possession of her&mdash;for she had known him
long and he had been a friend to her father when
friends were few; she stood looking straight at
him.
</p>
<p>He gave her one quick, penetrating glance, and
then stepped back, astonishment and recognition
in his eyes. Then he took a quick step forward
and seized her hands, holding her at arm&#8217;s length,
his eyes leaping in admiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if it ain&#8217;t Hagar Catherson!&#8221; he said,
wonder in his voice. &#8220;Have you just got out of a
fairy book?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Old friendship was speaking here; Ruth could
not fail to understand that.
</p>
<p>But he had not yet finished. &#8220;Why, I
reckon&mdash;&#8221; he began. And then he saw Ruth,
and his lips wreathed in a delighted grin. &#8220;You&#8217;re
the fairy, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; And then he sobered.
&#8220;Shucks. I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; nonsense, ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;ve
come to tell you that the grass ain&#8217;t what it ought
to be where we&#8217;ve been, an&#8217; tomorrow we&#8217;re
drivin&#8217; past here to go down the river.&#8221; He was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
still holding Hagar&#8217;s hands, and now he seemed
to realize that perhaps he had been too effusive,
and he flushed and dropped them. &#8220;You was just
goin&#8217;, I reckon,&#8221; he said to the girl. And at her
nod, and a quick, pleased glance from her eyes, he
added: &#8220;Tell your dad that I&#8217;m comin&#8217; over to
see him, pretty soon. I&#8217;d have been over before,
but I&#8217;ve been sort of busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been a-hopin&#8217; you&#8217;d come,&#8221; answered
Hagar. And with another smile at Ruth she
stepped off the porch and mounted her pony.
</p>
<p>Randerson went directly to his room, and Ruth
stood for a long time at the door, watching Hagar
as she rode her pony over the plains. There was
a queer sensation of resentment in her breast over
this exhibition of friendship; she had never
thought of them knowing each other. She smiled
after a while, however, telling herself that it was
nothing to her. But the next time that she saw
Hagar she ascertained her age. It was seventeen.
</p>
<p>The outfit came in the next morning&mdash;fourteen
punchers, the horse-wrangler having trouble as
usual with the <i>remuda</i>, the cook, Chavis, and
Pickett. They veered the herd toward the river
and drove it past the ranchhouse and into a grass
level that stretched for miles. It was near noon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
when the chuck wagon came to a halt near the
bunkhouse door, and from the porch of her house
Ruth witnessed a scene that she had been anticipating
since her first day in the West&mdash;a
group of cowboys at play.
</p>
<p>Did these men of the plains know that their new
boss had been wanting to see them in their unrestrained
moments? They acted like boys&mdash;more
mischievous than boys in their most frolicsome
moods. Their movements were grotesque,
their gestures extravagant, their talk high-pitched
and flavored with a dialect that Ruth had never
heard. They were &#8220;showing off&#8221;; the girl knew
that. But she also knew that in their actions was
much of earnestness, that an excess of vigor filled
them. They were like their horses which now
unleashed in the corral were running, neighing,
kicking up their heels in their momentary delight
of freedom.
</p>
<p>The girl understood and sympathized with
them, but she caught a glimpse of Chavis and
Pickett, sitting close together on a bench at the
front of the messhouse, talking seriously, and a
cloud came over her face. These two men were
not light-hearted as the others. What was the
reason? When she went into the house a few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
minutes later, a premonition of impending trouble
assailed her and would not be dismissed.
</p>
<p>She helped Aunt Martha in the kitchen. Uncle
Jepson had gone away&mdash;&#8220;nosin&#8217; around,&#8221; he
had said; Masten had ridden away toward the
river some time before&mdash;he had seemed to ride
toward the break in the canyon which led to the
Catherson cabin; she did not know where Randerson
had gone&mdash;had not seen him for hours.
</p>
<p>Hilarious laughter reached her, busy in the
kitchen, but it did not banish the peculiar uneasiness
that afflicted her. And some time later,
when the laughter ceased and she went to the
window and looked out, the cowboys had vanished.
They had gone in to dinner. But Chavis and
Pickett still sat on their bench, talking. Ruth
shivered and turned from the window.
</p>
<p>She was in better spirits shortly after dinner,
and went out to the stable to look at her pony.
Because of the coming of the <i>remuda</i> she had
thought it best to take her pony from the corral,
for she feared that in company with the other
horses her own animal would return to those
ungentle habits which she disliked.
</p>
<p>She fed it from some grain in a bin, carried
some water in a pail from the trough at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
windmill, and stood at the pony&#8217;s head for some
time, watching it. Just as she was about to turn
to leave the stable, she felt the interior darken,
and she wheeled quickly to see that the door had
closed, and that Jim Pickett stood before it,
grinning at her.
</p>
<p>For a moment her knees shook, for she could
not fail to interpret the expression of his face, then
she heard a gale of laughter from the direction
of the bunkhouse, and felt reassured. But while
she stood, she heard the sounds of the laughter
growing gradually indistinct and distant, and she
gulped hard. For she knew that the cowboys
were riding away&mdash;no doubt to join the herd.
</p>
<p>She pretended to be interested in the pony, and
stroked its mane with a hand that trembled, delaying
to move in the hope that she might
be mistaken in her fears and that Pickett would
go away. But Pickett did not move. Glancing
at him furtively, she saw that the grin was still
on his face and that he was watching her narrowly.
Then, finding that he seemed determined to stay,
she pretended unconcern and faced him, meeting
his gaze fearlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there something that you wanted to talk to
me about, Pickett?&#8221; she questioned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said respectfully, though his
voice seemed slightly hoarse, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a letter
here which I want you to read to me&mdash;I just
can&#8217;t sorta make out the writin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She almost sighed with relief. Leaving the
stall she went to Pickett&#8217;s side and took from his
hand a paper that he held out to her. And now,
in her relief over her discovery that his intentions
were not evil, it suddenly dawned on her that she
had forgotten that the door was closed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is dark here,&#8221; she said; &#8220;open the door,
please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Instead of answering, he seized the hand holding
the paper, and with a swift pull tried to draw
her toward him. But her muscles had been tensed
with the second fear that had taken possession of
her, and she resisted&mdash;almost broke away from
him. His fingers slipped from her wrist, the nails
scratching the flesh deeply, and she sprang toward
the door. But he was upon her instantly, his
arms around her, pinning her own to her sides,
and then he squeezed her to him, so tightly that
the breath almost left her body, and kissed her
three or four times full on the lips. Then, still
holding her, and looking in her eyes with an expression
that filled her with horror, he said huskily:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, but you&#8217;re a hummer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, as though that were the limit of his intentions,
he released her, laughed mirthlessly and
threw the door open.
</p>
<p>She had spoken no word during the attack. She
made no sound now, as she went toward the
house, her face ashen, her breath coming in great
gasps. But a few minutes later she was in her
room in the ranchhouse, on her bed, her face in
the pillow, sobbing out the story of the attack to
Aunt Martha, whose wrinkled face grew gray
with emotion as she listened.
</p>
<p>Masten came in an hour later. Ruth was in a
chair in the sitting-room, looking very white.
Aunt Martha was standing beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what has happened?&#8221; Masten took a
few steps and stood in front of her, looking down
at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunty will tell you.&#8221; Ruth hid her face in
her hands and cried softly.
</p>
<p>Aunt Martha led the way into the kitchen,
Masten following. Before he reached the door he
looked back at Ruth, and a slight smile, almost a
sneer, crossed his face. But when he turned to
Aunt Martha, in the kitchen, his eyes were alight
with well simulated curiosity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he said, questioningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is most outrageous,&#8221; began Aunt Martha,
her voice trembling. &#8220;That man, Pickett, came
upon Ruth in the stable and abused her shamefully.
He actually kissed her&mdash;three or four
times&mdash;and&mdash;Why, Mr. Masten, the prints of
his fingers are on her wrists!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth, in the sitting-room, waited, almost in
dread, for the explosion that she knew would
follow Aunt Martha&#8217;s words.
</p>
<p>None came, and Ruth sank back in her chair,
not knowing whether she was relieved or disappointed.
There was a long silence, during which
Masten cleared his throat three times. And then
came Aunt Martha&#8217;s voice, filled with mingled
wonder and impatience:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to do something Mr.
Masten? Such a thing ought not to go unpunished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thunder!&#8221; he said fretfully, &#8220;what on earth
<i>can</i> I do? You don&#8217;t expect me to go out and
<i>fight</i> that man, Pickett. He&#8217;d kill me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe he would,&#8221; said Aunt Martha in a
slightly cold voice, &#8220;but he would know that
Ruth was engaged to a <i>man!</i>&#8221; There was a
silence. And again came Aunt Martha&#8217;s voice:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time when men thought it an
honor to fight for their women. But it seems
that times have changed mightily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an age of reason, and not muscle and
murder,&#8221; replied Masten. &#8220;There is no more
reason why I should go out there and allow
Pickett to kill me than there is a reason why I
should go to the first railroad, lay my head on
the track and let a train run over me. There is law
in this country, aunty, and it can reach Pickett.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your self-control does you credit, Mr.
Masten.&#8221; Aunt Martha&#8217;s voice was low,
flavored with sarcasm. Masten turned abruptly
from her and went in to Ruth. Her face was
still in her hands, but she felt his presence and
involuntarily shrank from him.
</p>
<p>He turned his head from her and smiled,
toward the stable, and then he laid a hand on
Ruth&#8217;s shoulder and spoke comfortingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad, Ruth. But we shall find a way
to deal with Pickett without having murder done.
Why not have Randerson discharge him? He
is range boss, you know. In the meantime, can&#8217;t
you manage to stay away from places where the
men might molest you? They are all unprincipled
scoundrels, you must remember!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>He left her, after a perfunctory caress which
she suffered in silence. She saw him, later, as he
passed her window, talking seriously to Chavis,
and she imagined he was telling Chavis about the
attack. Of course, she thought, with a wave of
bitterness, Chavis would be able to sympathize
with him. She went to her room shortly afterward.
</p>
<p>The sun was swimming in a sea of saffron above
the mountains in the western distance when Ruth
again came downstairs. Hearing voices in the
kitchen she went to the door and looked. Aunt
Martha was standing near the kitchen table.
Randerson was standing close to her, facing her,
dwarfing her, his face white beneath the deep tan
upon it, his lips straight and hard, his eyes narrowed,
his teeth clenched; she could see the
corded muscles of his lean under-jaw, set and
stiff. Aunt Martha&#8217;s hands were on his sleeves;
her eyes were big and bright, and glowing with a
strange light.
</p>
<p>They did not see Ruth, and something in their
attitudes kept her from revealing herself; she
stood silent, listening, fascinated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So he done that!&#8221; It was Randerson&#8217;s voice,
and it made Ruth&#8217;s heart feel heavy and cold
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
within her, for in it was contempt, intolerance,
rage suppressed&mdash;she felt that the words had
come through clenched teeth. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll be
seein&#8217; Pickett, aunty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then he patted Aunt Martha&#8217;s shoulders
and started for the back door. Ruth heard him
open it; he must have been standing on the
threshold when he spoke again. And this time
he spoke in a drawl&mdash;slow, gentle:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll go wash. It was mighty dusty
ridin&#8217; today. I passed Calamity, aunty. There
ain&#8217;t no mud there any more; Willard wouldn&#8217;t
get mussed up, now. The suck-hole ain&#8217;t a foot
deep any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a scapegrace,&#8221; said Aunt Martha
severely. Ruth felt that she was shaking a
deprecatory finger at him. &#8220;Your manners have
been neglected.&#8221; But Aunt Martha&#8217;s voice gave
the words an exactly opposite meaning, and Ruth
blushed.
</p>
<p>There had been a dread fear in Ruth&#8217;s heart.
For she had seen warning of impending tragedy
in Randerson&#8217;s face when she had looked at him.
It seemed to have passed. His, &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll
be seein&#8217; Pickett,&#8221; meant, perhaps, that he would
discharge the man. Relieved, she went upstairs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
again and sat in a chair, looking out of a window.
</p>
<p>A little later she saw several of the cowboys
come in. She saw Pickett standing near a corner
of the bunkhouse. She watched him closely, for
there was something strange in his actions. He
seemed to be waiting for something, or somebody.
Occasionally he leaned against the corner
of the bunkhouse, but she noted that he kept turning
his head, keeping a lookout in all directions.
Again a premonition of imminent trouble
oppressed her.
</p>
<p>And then she saw Randerson going from the
ranchhouse toward the men who were congregated
in front of the bunkhouse; saw Pickett&#8217;s
right hand fall to his side as though it rested on
a holster, and she started out of her chair, for
illumination now came to her.
</p>
<p>Half way to the bunkhouse, Randerson was
met by Uncle Jepson. She saw Randerson stop,
observed that Uncle Jepson seemed to say something
to him. She could not, of course, hear the
words, &#8220;Look out, Randerson; Pickett&#8217;s layin&#8217;
for you,&#8221; but she saw Randerson lay a hand on
Uncle Jepson&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>And then he continued on his way.
</p>
<p>She saw Randerson go close to Pickett, noted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
that the other men had all turned and were watching
the two. Randerson seemed to be speaking,
to Pickett; the latter had faced him. Then, as
she breathlessly watched, she saw Pickett reach
for his gun. Randerson leaped. Pickett&#8217;s gun
did not come out, Randerson&#8217;s hand had closed
on Pickett&#8217;s wrist.
</p>
<p>There was a brief, fierce struggle, blows were
struck, and then the men sprang apart. Ruth
saw Randerson&#8217;s right arm describe a rapid half-circle;
she seemed to hear a thud as his fist landed,
and Pickett reeled and fell sideways to the ground,
close to the wall of the bunkhouse. She heard
him curse; saw him reach again for the gun at his
hip. The toe of Randerson&#8217;s right boot struck
Pickett&#8217;s hand, driving it away from the holster;
the hand was ground into the dust by Randerson&#8217;s
boot. And then, so quickly that she could not
follow the movement, Randerson&#8217;s gun was out,
and Pickett lay still where he had fallen.
</p>
<p>Presently Ruth saw Pickett get up, still menaced
by Randerson&#8217;s gun. Cursing, crouching, evidently
still awaiting an opportunity to draw his
gun, Pickett began to walk toward the ranchhouse,
Randerson close behind him. At a safe
distance, the other men followed&mdash;Ruth saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Masten and Chavis come out of the bunkhouse
door and follow also. The thought struck her
that they must have witnessed the incident from
a window. She saw them all, the cowboys at a
respectable distance, Pickett and Randerson in
front, with Masten and Chavis far behind, come
to a halt. She divined&mdash;she believed she had
suspected all along&mdash;what the march to the
ranchhouse meant, but still she did not move, for
she feared she could not stand.
</p>
<p>Ruth was roused, however, by Randerson&#8217;s
voice. It reached her, sharp, cold, commanding.
Evidently he was speaking to Aunt Martha,
or to Uncle Jepson, who had gone into the house:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Miss Ruth to come here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth obeyed. A moment later she stood on
the front porch, looking at them all. This scene
seemed unreal to her&mdash;the cowboys at a distance,
Masten and Chavis in the rear, looking on, Pickett
near the edge of the porch, his face bloated with
impotent rage, his eyes glaring; the grim figure
that Randerson made as he stood near Pickett,
gun in hand, his eyes narrowed, alert. It seemed
to her to be a dream from which she would
presently awaken, trembling from the horror of it.
</p>
<p>And then again she heard Randerson&#8217;s voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
It was low, but so burdened with passion that it
seemed to vibrate in the perfect silence. There
was a threat of death in it:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell Miss Ruth that you&#8217;re never
goin&#8217; to play the skunk with a woman ag&#8217;in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pickett writhed. But it seemed to Ruth, as her
gaze shifted from Randerson to him, that Pickett&#8217;s
manner was not what it should be. He was
not embarrassed enough, did not seem to feel his
disgrace keenly enough. For though he twisted
and squirmed under the threat in Randerson&#8217;s
voice, there was an odd smirk on his face that
impressed her as nearly concealing a malignant
cunning. And his voice sounded insincere to her&mdash;there
was even no flavor of shame in them:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I done what I did, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s all, Pickett. You draw your
time right now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Randerson sheathed his pistol and turned
slightly sidewise to Pickett, evidently intending to
come up on the porch.
</p>
<p>Ruth gasped. For she saw Pickett reach for
his gun. It was drawn half out of its holster. As
though he had divined what was in Pickett&#8217;s mind,
Randerson had turned slightly at Pickett&#8217;s movement.
There was a single rapid movement to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
his right hip, the twilight was split by a red streak,
by another that followed it so closely as to seem
to make the two continuous. Pickett&#8217;s hand
dropped oddly from the half-drawn weapon, his
knees sagged, he sighed and pitched heavily forward,
face down, at Randerson&#8217;s feet.
</p>
<p>Dimly, as through a haze, Ruth saw a number
of the cowboys coming toward her, saw them
approach and look curiously down at the thing
that lay almost at her feet. And then someone
took her by the arm&mdash;she thought it was Uncle
Jepson&mdash;and she was led toward the door. At
the threshold she paused, for Randerson&#8217;s voice,
cold and filled with deadly definiteness, reached
her:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to take his end of this?&#8221; Ruth
turned. Randerson was pointing to Pickett&#8217;s body,
ghastly in its prone slackness. He was looking
at Chavis.
</p>
<p>Evidently Chavis elected not to avenge his
friend at that moment. For there was a dead
silence while one might have counted fifty. Then
Ruth was drawn into the house.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>WHAT UNCLE JEPSON HEARD</h3>
</div>

<p>Every detail of the killing of Jim Pickett
remained vivid in Ruth&#8217;s recollection. She
felt that she would never forget it. But her
horror gradually abated, and at the end of a
week she was able to look at Randerson without
shuddering. During the week she had evaded
him. And he, divining the state of her feelings,
kept away from the house as much as possible.
</p>
<p>Masten&#8217;s demeanor on hearing of the insult
that had been offered her by Pickett had seemed
that of a man who was lacking in courage: at
the time she had not been able to make it conform
to her ideas of a man&#8217;s duty to the woman
he had promised to marry&mdash;or to any woman.
She had heard him speak of reason in connection
with the affair, as though there were no such
thing in the world as rage so justifiable as to make
a man yearn to inflict punishment upon another
man who had attacked his woman. He had
looked upon the matter cold-bloodedly, and she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
had resented that. But now that she had been
avenged, she felt that she had been wrong. It
had been such a trivial thing, after all; the punishment
seemed monstrous in comparison with it.
She had seen Pickett&#8217;s movement when Randerson
had momentarily turned his back to him,
but she had also seen Randerson&#8217;s retaliatory
movement. She had known then, that Randerson
had expected Pickett&#8217;s action, and that he
had been prepared for it, and therefore it seemed
to her that in forcing the trouble Randerson had
not only foreseen the ending but had even courted
it.
</p>
<p>Remorse over her momentary doubt of
Masten&#8217;s motive in refusing to call Pickett to
account, afflicted her. He had been wiser than
she; he had traced the line that divided reason
from the primitive passions&mdash;man from beast.
His only reference to the incident&mdash;a wordless
one, which she felt was sufficiently eloquent&mdash;came
when one day, while they were standing
beside the corral fence, looking at the horses,
they saw Randerson riding in. Masten nodded
toward him and shook his head slowly from side
to side, compressing his lips as he did so. And
then, seeing her looking at him, he smiled compassionately,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
as though to say that he regretted
the killing of Pickett as well as she.
</p>
<p>She seized his arm impulsively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wrong, Willard,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong, dear?&#8221; he said. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t your
fault.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought&mdash;things about you that I
shouldn&#8217;t have thought. I felt that you ought to
have punished Pickett. I am glad, now, that you
didn&#8217;t.&#8221; She shuddered, and looked again at
Randerson, just dismounting at the bunkhouse,
paying no attention to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you wouldn&#8217;t have me like him?&#8221; He
indicated Randerson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>He gave her shoulder a slight pressure, and
turning his head, smiled triumphantly.
</p>
<p>Later, when they had walked to a far corner
of the pasture, talking confidentially and laughing
a little, he halted and drew her close to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth,&#8221; he said, gently, &#8220;the world is going
very well for you now. You are settled here,
you like it, and things are running smoothly.
Why not take a ride over to Lazette one of these
days. There is a justice of the peace over there.
It won&#8217;t need to be a formal affair, you know.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
Just on the quiet&mdash;a sort of a lark. I have
waited a long time,&#8221; he coaxed.
</p>
<p>She smiled at his earnestness. But that spark
which he had tried in vain to fan into flame still
smoldered. She felt no responsive impulse; a
strange reluctance dragged at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Willard,&#8221; she said, &#8220;until after the
fall round-up. There is no hurry. We are sure
of each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went on toward the ranchhouse. When
they passed the bunkhouse, and through the open
door saw Randerson and Uncle Jepson sitting on
a bench smoking, Ruth quickened her step, and
Masten made a grimace of hatred.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Inside the bunkhouse, Uncle Jepson, who had
been speaking, paused long enough to wrinkle
his nose at Masten. Randerson&#8217;s expression did
not change; it was one of grave expectancy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You was sayin&#8217;&mdash;&#8221; he prompted, looking at
Uncle Jepson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That the whole darned deal was a frame-up,&#8221;
declared Uncle Jepson. &#8220;I was settin&#8217; in
the messhouse along in the afternoon of the day
of the killin&#8217;&mdash;smokin&#8217; an&#8217; thinkin&#8217;, but most
of the time just settin&#8217;, I cal&#8217;late, when I heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Chavis an&#8217; Pickett talkin&#8217; low an&#8217; easy outside.
They was a crack in the wall, an&#8217; I plastered one
ear up ag&#8217;in it, an&#8217; took in all they was sayin&#8217;.
First, they was talkin&#8217; about the bad feelin&#8217;
between you an&#8217; Pickett. Pickett said he wanted
to &#8216;git&#8217; you, an&#8217; that Masten wanted to get you
out of the way because of what you&#8217;d done to him
at Calamity. But I reckon that ain&#8217;t the real
reason; he&#8217;s got some idea that you an&#8217; Ruth&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks,&#8221; said Randerson impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; grinned Uncle Jepson, &#8220;for some
reason, he don&#8217;t want you hangin&#8217; around. Far
as I could gather, Pickett wanted some excuse to
have you fire him, so&#8217;s he could shoot you. He
talked some to Masten about it, an&#8217; Masten told
him to tackle Ruth, but not to get too rough about
it, an&#8217; not to go too far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great guns! The low-down, mean, sneakin&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;
said Randerson. His eyes were glowing; his
words came with difficulty through his straightened
lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Masten wouldn&#8217;t take it up, he told Pickett,&#8221;
went on Uncle Jepson. &#8220;He&#8217;d put it up to you.
An&#8217; when you&#8217;d tackle Pickett about it, Pickett
would shoot you. If they was any chance for
Chavis to help along, he&#8217;d do it. But mostly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Pickett was to do the job. I cal&#8217;late that&#8217;s about
all&mdash;except that I layed for you an&#8217; told you
to look out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard this talk after&mdash;after Pickett
had&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; growled Uncle Jepson, a
venomous flash in his eyes, slightly reproachful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;of course,&#8221; agreed Randerson. He
was grim-eyed; there was cold contempt in the
twist of his lips. He sat for a long time, silent,
staring out through the door, Uncle Jepson watching
him, subdued by the look in his eyes.
</p>
<p>When he spoke at last, there was a cold, bitter
humor in his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s Willard&#8217;s measure!&#8221; he said. &#8220;He
grades up like a side-winder slidin&#8217; under the
sagebrush. There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; clean about him but
his clothes. But he&#8217;s playin&#8217; a game&mdash;him an&#8217;
Chavis. An&#8217; I&#8217;m the guy they&#8217;re after!&#8221; He
laughed, and Uncle Jepson shivered. &#8220;She&#8217;s seen
one killin&#8217;, an&#8217; I reckon, if she stays here a while
longer, she&#8217;ll see another: Chavis&#8217;.&#8221; He stopped
and then went on: &#8220;Why, I reckon Chavis
dyin&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t make no more impression on her
than Pickett dyin&#8217;. But I reckon she thinks a
heap of Willard, don&#8217;t she, Uncle Jep?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
&#8220;If a girl promises&mdash;&#8221; began Uncle Jepson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon&mdash;&#8221; interrupted Randerson. And
then he shut his lips and looked grimly out at
the horses in the corral.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you reckon she&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221; Randerson began
again, after a short silence. &#8220;No,&#8221; he answered
the question himself, &#8220;I reckon if you&#8217;d tell her
she wouldn&#8217;t believe you. No good woman will
believe anything bad about the man she loves&mdash;or
thinks she loves. But Willard&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got up, walked out the door, mounted
Patches and rode away. Going to the door,
Uncle Jepson watched him until he faded into the
shimmering sunshine of the plains.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cal&#8217;late that Willard&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he, too, left his speech unfinished, as
though thought had suddenly ceased, or speculation
had become futile and ridiculous.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;SOMETHIN&#8217;S GONE OUT OF THEM&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>As Randerson rode Patches through the break
in the canyon wall in the afternoon of a
day about a week after his talk with Uncle Jepson
in the bunkhouse, he was thinking of the visit he
intended to make. He had delayed it long. He
had not seen Abe Catherson since taking his new
job.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m right unneighborly,&#8221;
he said to himself as he rode.
</p>
<p>When he reached the nester&#8217;s cabin, the dog
Nig greeted him with vociferous affection, bringing
Hagar to the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Rex!&#8221; cried the girl delightedly.
And then, reproachfully: &#8220;Me an&#8217; dad allowed
you wasn&#8217;t comin&#8217; any more!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You an&#8217; dad was a heap mistaken, then,&#8221; he
grinned as he dismounted and trailed the reins
over the pony&#8217;s head. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a heap to &#8217;tend
to,&#8221; he added as he stepped on the porch and
came to a halt, looking at her. &#8220;Why, I reckon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
the little kid I used to know ain&#8217;t here any more!&#8221;
he said, his eyes alight with admiration, as he
critically examined her garments from the distance
that separated her from him&mdash;a neat
house dress of striped gingham, high at the
throat, the bottom hem reaching below her shoe-tops;
a loose-fitting apron over the dress, drawn
tightly at the waist, giving her figure graceful
curves. He had never thought of Hagar in connection
with beauty; he had been sorry for her,
pitying her&mdash;she had been a child upon whom
he had bestowed much of the unselfish devotion
of his heart; indeed, there had been times when
it had assumed a practical turn, and through
various ruses much of his wages had been delicately
forced upon the nester. It had not always
been wisely expended, for he knew that Catherson
drank deeply at times.
</p>
<p>Now, however, Randerson realized that the
years must inevitably make a change in Hagar.
That glimpse he had had of her on the Flying W
ranchhouse porch had made him think, but her
appearance now caused him to think more deeply.
It made constraint come into his manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon your dad ain&#8217;t anywhere around?&#8221;
he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dad&#8217;s huntin&#8217; up some cattle this mornin&#8217;,&#8221;
she told him. &#8220;Shucks,&#8221; she added, seeing him
hesitate, &#8220;ain&#8217;t you comin&#8217; in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve been wonderin&#8217;&#8221; and he grinned
guiltily &#8220;whether it&#8217;d be exactly proper. You
see, there was a time when I busted right in the
house without waitin&#8217; for an invitation&mdash;tickled
to get a chance to dawdle a kid on my knee. But
I reckon them dawdle-days is over. I wouldn&#8217;t
think of tryin&#8217; to dawdle a <i>woman</i> on my knee.
But if you think that you&#8217;re still Hagar Catherson,
an&#8217; you won&#8217;t be dead-set on me dawdlin&#8217; you&mdash;Why,
shucks, I reckon I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; like a fool!&#8221;
And his face blushed crimson.
</p>
<p>Her face was red too, but she seemed to be less
conscious of the change in herself than he, though
her eyes drooped when he looked at her.
</p>
<p>He followed her inside and formally took a
chair, sitting on its edge and turning his hat over
and over in his hands, looking much at it, as
if it were new and he admired it greatly.
</p>
<p>But this constraint between them was not the
only thing that was new to him. While she talked,
he sat and listened, and stole covert glances at
her, and tried to convince himself that it was
really Hagar that was sitting there before him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>But before long he grew accustomed to the
strangeness of the situation, and constraint
dropped from him. &#8220;Why, I reckon it&#8217;s all natural,&#8221;
he confided to her. &#8220;Folks grow up, don&#8217;t
they? Take you. Yesterday you was a kid, an&#8217; I
dawdled you on my knee. Today you&#8217;re a woman,
an&#8217; it makes me feel some breathless to look at
you. But it&#8217;s all natural. I&#8217;d been seein&#8217; you so
much that I&#8217;d forgot that time was makin&#8217; a
woman of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She blushed, and he marveled over it. &#8220;She
can&#8217;t see, herself, how she&#8217;s changed,&#8221; he told
himself. And while they talked he studied her,
noting that her color was higher than he had ever
seen it, that the frank expression of her eyes had
somehow changed&mdash;there was a glow in them,
deep, abiding, embarrassed. They drooped from
his when he tried to hold her gaze. He had
always admired the frank directness of them&mdash;that
told of unconsciousness of sex, of unquestioning
trust. Today, it seemed to him, there was
subtle knowledge in them. He was puzzled and
disappointed. And when, half an hour later, he
took his leave, after telling her that he would
come again, to see her &#8220;dad,&#8221; he took her by the
shoulders and forced her to look into his eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
His own searched hers narrowly. It was as in
the old days&mdash;in his eyes she was still a child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I won&#8217;t kiss you no more, Hagar,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t a kid no more, an&#8217; it
wouldn&#8217;t be square. Seventeen is an awful old
age, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then he mounted and rode down the trail,
still puzzled over the lurking, deep glow in her
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I ain&#8217;t no expert on women&#8217;s eyes,&#8221;
he said as he rode. &#8220;But Hagar&#8217;s&mdash;there&#8217;s
somethin&#8217; gone out of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He could not have reached the break in the
canyon leading to the plains above the river, when
Willard Masten loped his horse toward the
Catherson cabin from an opposite direction.
</p>
<p>Hagar was standing on the porch when he
came, and her face flooded with color when she
saw him. She stood, her eyes drooping with shy
embarrassment as Masten dismounted and
approached her. And then, as his arm went
around her waist, familiarly, he whispered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;How is my little woman today?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She straightened and looked up at him, perplexity
in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Rex Randerson was just hyeh,&#8221; she said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
&#8220;I wanted to tell him about you wantin&#8217; me to
marry you. But I thought of what you told me,
an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t. Do you sure reckon he&#8217;d kill you,
if he knowed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly would,&#8221; declared Masten,
earnestly. &#8220;No one&mdash;not even your father&mdash;must
know that I come here to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I won&#8217;t tell. But Miss Ruth? Are
you sure she don&#8217;t care for you any more?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he lied glibly; &#8220;she has broken our
engagement. But if she knew that I come here to
see you she&#8217;d be jealous, you know. So it&#8217;s better
not to tell her. If you do tell her, I&#8217;ll stop
coming,&#8221; he threatened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to keep from tellin&#8217; folks how happy
I am,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Once, I was afraid Rex Randerson
could see it in my eyes&mdash;when he took
a-hold of my arms hyeh, an&#8217; looked at me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten looked jealously at her. &#8220;Looked at
you, eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Are you sure he didn&#8217;t try
to do anything else&mdash;didn&#8217;t <i>do</i> anything else?
Like kissing you, for instance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certain sure,&#8221; she replied, looking straight
at him. &#8220;He used to kiss me. But he says I&#8217;m a
woman, now, an&#8217; it wouldn&#8217;t be square to kiss me
any more.&#8221; Her eyes had drooped from his.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I reckon that&#8217;s right, too, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; She
looked up again, not receiving an answer. &#8220;Why,
how red your face is!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
said nothin&#8217; to hurt you, have I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. But he held her tightly to him,
her head on his shoulder, so that she might not see
the guilt in his eyes.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE LAW OF THE PRIMITIVE</h3>
</div>

<p>Randerson continued his policy of not
forcing himself upon Ruth. He went his
way, silent, thoughtful, attending strictly to business.
To Ruth, watching him when he least suspected
it, it seemed that he had grown more grim
and stern-looking since his coming to the Flying
W. She saw him, sometimes, laughing quietly
with Uncle Jepson; other times she heard him
talking gently to Aunt Martha&mdash;with an expression
that set her to wondering whether he were
the same man that she had seen that day with the
pistol in hand, shooting the life out of a fellow
being. There were times when she wavered in
her conviction of his heartlessness.
</p>
<p>Since Ruth had announced her decision not to
marry Masten until after the fall round-up, she
had not seen so much of him. He rode alone,
sometimes not even asking her to accompany him.
These omissions worked no great hardship on
her, for the days had grown hot and the plains
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
dry and dusty, so that there was not so much
enjoyment in riding as formerly. Besides, she
knew the country rather well now, and had no
need to depend upon Masten.
</p>
<p>Chavis had severed his connection with the
Flying W. He had ridden in to the ranchhouse
some weeks ago, found Ruth sitting on the porch,
announced that he was &#8220;quittin&#8217;&#8221; and wanted
his &#8220;time.&#8221; She did not ask him why he wanted
to quit so pleased was she with his decision, but
he advanced an explanation while she counted the
money due him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Things don&#8217;t suit me here,&#8221; he said
venomously. &#8220;Randerson is too fresh.&#8221; He
looked at her impudently. &#8220;Besides,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;he stands in too well with the boss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She flushed with indignation. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t
dare say that to <i>him</i>!&#8221; she declared.
</p>
<p>He reddened darkly. &#8220;Meanin&#8217; what he done
to Pickett, I reckon,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;Well, Randerson
will be gettin&#8217; his&#8217;n some day, too!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth remembered this conversation, and on a
day about a month later when she had gone riding
alone, she saw Randerson at a distance and
rode toward him to tell him, for she had meant
to, many times.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>Evidently Randerson had seen her, too, for he
had already altered his pony&#8217;s course when she
wheeled hers. When their ponies came to a halt
near each other it was Randerson who spoke first.
He looked at her unsmilingly over his pony&#8217;s
head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was ridin&#8217; in to the house to see you,
ma&#8217;am. I thought you ought to know. This
mornin&#8217; the boys found two cows with their hoofs
burned, an&#8217; their calves run off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Their hoofs burned!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Why,
who would be so inhuman as to do that? But I
suppose there was a fire somewhere, and it
happened that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a fire, all right,&#8221; he said grimly.
&#8220;Some one built it, on purpose. It was rustlers,
ma&#8217;am. They burned the hoofs of the mothers
so the mothers couldn&#8217;t follow when they drove
their calves off&mdash;like any mother would.&#8221; He
eyed her calmly. &#8220;I reckon it was Chavis,
ma&#8217;am. He&#8217;s got a shack down the crick a ways.
He&#8217;s been there ever since you paid him off. An&#8217;
this mornin&#8217; two of the boys told me they wanted
their time. I was goin&#8217; in to get it for them. It&#8217;s
likely they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to join Chavis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let them,&#8221; she said indignantly. &#8220;If
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
they are that kind of men, we don&#8217;t want them
around!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He smiled now for the first time. &#8220;I reckon
there ain&#8217;t no way to stop them from goin&#8217;, ma&#8217;am.
An&#8217; we sure don&#8217;t want them around. But when
they go with Chavis, it&#8217;s mighty likely that we&#8217;ll
miss more cattle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stiffened. &#8220;Come with me,&#8221; she ordered;
&#8220;they shall have their money right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She urged her pony on, and he fell in beside
her, keeping his animal&#8217;s muzzle near her stirrup.
For he was merely an employee and was filled
with respect for her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I could have Chavis charged with
stealing those two calves?&#8221; she asked, as they
rode. She looked back over her shoulder at him
and slowed her pony down so that he came
alongside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, ma&#8217;am, I reckon you could. You
could charge him with stealin&#8217; them. But that
wouldn&#8217;t prove it. We ain&#8217;t got any evidence,
you see. We found the cows, with the calves
gone. We know that Chavis is in the country,
but we didn&#8217;t see him doin&#8217; the stealin&#8217;; we only
think he done it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I should complain to the sheriff?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You could do that, ma&#8217;am. But I reckon it&#8217;s
a waste of time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, ma&#8217;am, the sheriff in this
county don&#8217;t amount to a heap&mdash;considered as
a sheriff. He mostly draws his salary an&#8217; keeps
out of trouble, much as he can. There ain&#8217;t no
court in the county nearer than Las Vegas, an&#8217;
that&#8217;s a hundred an&#8217; fifty miles from here. An&#8217;,
mostly, the court don&#8217;t want to be bothered with
hearin&#8217; rustler cases&mdash;there bein&#8217; no regular law
governin&#8217; them, an&#8217; conviction bein&#8217; hard to get.
So the sheriff don&#8217;t bother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there must be some way to stop them
from stealing!&#8221; she said sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s a way, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; And now
she heard him laugh, quietly, and again she turned
and looked at him. His face grew grave again,
instantly. &#8220;But I reckon you wouldn&#8217;t approve
of it, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would approve of most any method of
stopping them&mdash;within reason!&#8221; she declared
vindictively, nettled by his tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We mostly hang them, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a sure way of stoppin&#8217; them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She shuddered. &#8220;Do you mean that you hang
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
them without a court verdict&mdash;on your own
responsibility?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But doesn&#8217;t the sheriff punish men who hang
others in that manner?&#8221; she went on in tones
of horror.
</p>
<p>His voice was quietly humorous. &#8220;Them sort
of hangin&#8217;s ain&#8217;t advertised a heap. It&#8217;s hard to
find anybody that will admit he had a hand in it.
Nobody knows anything about it. But it&#8217;s done,
an&#8217; can&#8217;t be undone. An&#8217; the rustlin&#8217; stops mighty
sudden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;what a barbarous
custom!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it ain&#8217;t exactly barbarous, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he contended mildly. &#8220;Would you have the
rustlers go on stealin&#8217; forever, an&#8217; not try to stop
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the courts,&#8221; she insisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turnin&#8217; rustlers off scot-free, ma&#8217;am. They
can&#8217;t hold them. An&#8217; if a rustler is hung, he
don&#8217;t get any more than is comin&#8217; to him. Do
you reckon there&#8217;s a lot of difference between a
half dozen men hangin&#8217; a man for a crime he&#8217;s
done, than for one man, a judge for instance,
orderin&#8217; him to be hung? If, we&#8217;ll say, a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
men elect a judge to do certain things, is it any
more wrong for the hundred men to do them
things than for the man they&#8217;ve elected to do
them? I reckon not, ma&#8217;am. Of course, if the
hundred men did somethin&#8217; that the judge hadn&#8217;t
been elected to do, why then, it might make some
difference.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you say there is no law that provides
hanging for rustling.&#8221; She thought she had him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The men that elected the judge made the
laws,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They have a right to make
others, whenever they&#8217;re needed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mob law,&#8221; she said with a shiver.
&#8220;What would become of the world if that custom
were followed everywhere?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say that it would be a good thing
everywhere. Where there&#8217;s courts that can be
got at easy, there&#8217;d be no sense to it. But out
here there&#8217;s no other way for a man to protect
his property. He&#8217;s got to take the law into his
own hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a crude and cold-blooded way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She heard him laugh, and turned to see him
looking at her in amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no refinement in punishment,
ma&#8217;am. Either it&#8217;s got to shock some one or not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
get done at all. I reckon that back East you don&#8217;t
get to see anyone punished, or hung. You hear
about it, or you read about it, an&#8217; it don&#8217;t seem
so near you, an&#8217; that kind of takes the edge off
it. Out here it comes closer, an&#8217; it seems a lot
cruel. But whether a man&#8217;s punished by the law
or by the men who make the law wouldn&#8217;t make a
lot of difference to the man&mdash;he&#8217;d be punished
anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t talk about it any further,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;But understand, if there are any cattle
thieves caught on the Flying W they must not be
hanged. You must capture them, if possible, and
take them to the proper officials, that they may
have a fair trial. And we shall abide by the
court&#8217;s decision. I don&#8217;t care to have any more
murders committed here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His face paled. &#8220;Referrin&#8217; to Pickett, I
reckon, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She flung the monosyllable back at
him resentfully.
</p>
<p>She felt him ride close to her, and she looked
at him and saw that his face was grimly serious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t been thinkin&#8217; of the killin&#8217; of Pickett
as murder, ma&#8217;am. Pickett had it comin&#8217; to him.
You was standin&#8217; on the porch, an&#8217; I reckon you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
used your eyes. If you did, you saw Pickett try
to pull his gun on me when my back was turned.
It was either him or me, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You anticipated that he would try to shoot
you,&#8221; she charged. &#8220;Your actions showed
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I reckon I did. You see, I&#8217;ve knowed
Pickett for a long time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was watching you from an upstairs window,&#8221;
she went on. &#8220;I saw you when you struck
Pickett with your fist. You drew your pistol while
he was on the ground. You had the advantage&mdash;you
might have taken his pistol away from
him, and prevented any further trouble. Instead,
you allowed him to keep it. You expected he
would try to shoot you, and you deliberately gave
him an opportunity, relying upon your quickness
in getting your own pistol out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I give him his chance, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His chance.&#8221; There was derision in her
voice. &#8220;I have talked to some of the men about
you. They say you are the cleverest of any man
in this vicinity with a weapon. You deliberately
planned to kill him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He rode on, silently, a glint of cold humor in
his eyes. He might now have confounded her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
with the story of Masten&#8217;s connection with the
affair, but he had no intention of telling her.
Masten had struck the blow at him&mdash;Masten it
must be, who would be struck back.
</p>
<p>However, he was disturbed over her attitude.
He did not want her to think that he had killed
Pickett in pure wantonness, for he had not thought
of shooting the man until Uncle Jepson had
warned him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to tell you this, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said,
riding close to her. &#8220;One man&#8217;s life is as good
as another&#8217;s in this country. But it ain&#8217;t any
better. The law&#8217;s too far away to monkey with&mdash;law
like you&#8217;re used to. The gun a man
carries is the only law anyone here pays any
attention to. Every man knows it. Nobody
makes any mistakes about it, unless it&#8217;s when they
don&#8217;t get their gun out quick enough. An&#8217; that&#8217;s
the man&#8217;s fault that pulls the gun. There ain&#8217;t
no officials to do any guardin&#8217; out here; you&#8217;ve
got to do it yourself or it don&#8217;t get done. A man
can&#8217;t take too many chances&mdash;an&#8217; live to tell
about it. When you know a man&#8217;s lookin&#8217; for
you, yearnin&#8217; to perforate you, it&#8217;s just a question
of who can shoot the quickest an&#8217; the straightest.
In the case of Pickett, I happened to be the one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
It might have been Pickett. If he wasn&#8217;t as fast
as me in slingin&#8217; his gun, why, he oughtn&#8217;t to have
taken no chance. He&#8217;d have been plumb safe if
he&#8217;d have forgot all about his gun. I don&#8217;t reckon
that I&#8217;d have pined away with sorrow if I hadn&#8217;t
shot him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was much impressed with his earnestness,
and she looked quickly at him, nearly convinced.
But again the memory of the tragic moment
became vivid in her thoughts, and she shuddered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too horrible to think of!&#8221; she declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s no picnic,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t never been stuck on shootin&#8217; men. I reckon
I didn&#8217;t sleep a heap for three nights after I shot
Pickett. I kept seein&#8217; him, an&#8217; pityin&#8217; him. But
I kept tellin&#8217; myself that it had to be either him
or me, an&#8217; I kind of got over it. Pickett <i>would</i>
have it, ma&#8217;am. When I turned my back to him
I was hopin&#8217; that he wouldn&#8217;t try to play dirt on
me. Do you reckon he oughtn&#8217;t to have been
made to tell you that he had been wrong in
tacklin&#8217; you? Why, ma&#8217;am, I kind of liked
Pickett. He wasn&#8217;t all bad. He was one of them
kind that&#8217;s easy led, an&#8217; he wasn&#8217;t a heap responsible;
he fell in with the wrong kind of men&mdash;men
like Chavis. I&#8217;ve took a lot from Pickett.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You might have shown him in some other
way that you liked him,&#8221; she said with unsmiling
sarcasm. &#8220;It seems to me that men who go about
thinking of shooting each other must have a great
deal of the brute in them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; that they ain&#8217;t civilized, I reckon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Mr. Masten had the right view. He
refused to resort to the methods you used in
bringing Pickett to account. He is too much a
gentleman to act the savage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For an instant Randerson&#8217;s eyes lighted with
a deep fire. And then he smiled mirthlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon Mr. Masten ain&#8217;t never had anybody
stir him up right proper,&#8221; he said mildly.
&#8220;It takes different things to get a man riled so&#8217;s
he&#8217;ll fight&mdash;or a woman, either. Either of &#8217;em
will fight when the right thing gets them roused. I
expect that deep down in everybody is a little of
that brute that you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about. I reckon
you&#8217;d fight like a tiger, ma&#8217;am, if the time ever
come when you had to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never expect to kill anybody,&#8221; she declared,
coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ll do when the
time comes, ma&#8217;am. You&#8217;ve been livin&#8217; in a part
of the country where things are done accordin&#8217; to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
hard an&#8217; fast rules. Out here things run loose,
an&#8217; if you stay here long enough some day you&#8217;ll
meet them an&#8217; recognize them for your own&mdash;an&#8217;
you&#8217;ll wonder how you ever got along without
them.&#8221; He looked at her now with a subtle
grin. But his words were direct enough, and his
voice rang earnestly as he went on: &#8220;Why, I
reckon you&#8217;ve never been tuned up to nature,
ma&#8217;am. Have you ever hated anybody real
venomous?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been taught differently,&#8221; she shot back
at him. &#8220;I have never hated anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ain&#8217;t never loved anybody, ma&#8217;am.
You&#8217;d be jealous of the one you loved, an&#8217; you&#8217;d
hate anybody you saw makin&#8217; eyes at them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of all the odd ideas!&#8221; she said. She
was so astonished at the turn his talk had taken
that she halted her pony and faced him, her cheeks
coloring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon it&#8217;s any odd idea, ma&#8217;am.
Unless human nature is an odd idea, an&#8217; I reckon
it&#8217;s about the oldest thing in the world, next to
love an&#8217; hate.&#8221; He grinned at her unblushingly,
and leaned against the saddle horn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you ain&#8217;t been a heap observin&#8217;,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said frankly, but very respectfully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;d have seen that odd idea worked out many
times, if you was. With animals an&#8217; men it&#8217;s the
same. A kid&mdash;which you won&#8217;t claim don&#8217;t love
its mother&mdash;is jealous of a brother or a sister
which it thinks is bein&#8217; favored more than him,
an&#8217; if the mother don&#8217;t show that she&#8217;s pretty
square in dealin&#8217; with the two, there&#8217;s bound to be
hate born right there. What do you reckon made
Cain kill his brother, Abel?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a woman&mdash;a wife. Some box-heads,
when their wife falls in love with another man,
give her up like they was takin&#8217; off an old shoe,
sayin&#8217; they love her so much that they want to see
her happy&mdash;which she can&#8217;t be, she says, unless
she gets the other man. But don&#8217;t you go to
believin&#8217; that kind of fairy romance, ma&#8217;am.
When a man is so willin&#8217; to give up his wife to
another man he&#8217;s sure got a heap tired of her
an&#8217; don&#8217;t want her any more. He&#8217;s got his eye
peeled for Number Two, an&#8217; he&#8217;s thankin&#8217; his
wife&#8217;s lover for makin&#8217; the trail clear for the
matrimonial wagon. But givin&#8217; up Number One
to the other man gives him a chance to pose a lot,
an&#8217; mebbe it&#8217;s got a heap of effect on Number
Two, who sort of thinks that if she gets tied up
to such a sucker she&#8217;ll be able to wrap him around
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
her finger. But if he loves Number Two, he&#8217;ll be
mighty grumpy to the next fellow that goes to
makin&#8217; sheeps eyes at her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a highly original view,&#8221; she said,
laughing, feeling that she ought to be offended,
but disarmed by his ingenuousness. &#8220;And so
you think that love and hate are inseparable passions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you can&#8217;t know what real love is
unless you have hated, ma&#8217;am. Some folks say
they get through life without hatin&#8217; anybody, but
if you&#8217;ll look around an&#8217; watch them, you&#8217;ll find
they&#8217;re mostly an unfeelin&#8217; kind. You ain&#8217;t one
of them kind, ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;ve watched you, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve
seen that you&#8217;ve got a heap of spirit. Some of
these days you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to wake up. An&#8217; when
you do, you&#8217;ll find out what love is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I love Mr. Masten?&#8221; she
said, looking at him unwaveringly.
</p>
<p>He looked as fairly back at her. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
reckon you do, ma&#8217;am. Mebbe you think so, but
you don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221; she demanded,
defiantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the way you look at him, ma&#8217;am. If
I was engaged to a girl an&#8217; she looked at me as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
critical as you look at him, sometimes, I&#8217;d sure
feel certain that I&#8217;d drawed the wrong card.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still her eyes did not waver. She began to
sense his object in introducing this subject, and
she was determined to make him feel that his
conclusions were incorrect&mdash;as she knew they
were.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is an example of your wonderful power
of observation,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the kind you were
telling me about, which makes you able to make
such remarkable deductions. But if you are no
more correct in the others than you are in trying
to determine the state of my feelings toward Mr.
Masten, you are entirely wrong. I <i>do</i> love
Mr. Masten!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She spoke vehemently, for she thought herself
very much in earnest.
</p>
<p>But he grinned. &#8220;You&#8217;re true blue,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;an&#8217; you&#8217;ve got the grit to tell where you stand.
But you&#8217;re mistaken. You couldn&#8217;t love Masten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she said, so intensely curious that
she entirely forgot to think of his impertinence
in talking thus to her. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t I love
Mr. Masten?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed, and reddened. &#8220;Because you&#8217;re
goin&#8217; to love me, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, gently.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>She would have laughed if she had not felt so
indignant. She would have struck him as she
had struck Chavis had she not been positive that
behind his words was the utmost respect&mdash;that
he did not intend to be impertinent&mdash;that he
seemed as natural as he had been all along. She
would have exhibited scorn if she could have summoned
it. She did nothing but stare at him in
genuine amazement. She was going to be severe
with him, but the mild humor of his smile brought
confusion upon her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t lack conceit, whatever your other
shortcomings,&#8221; she managed, her face rosy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well now, I&#8217;m thankin&#8217; you, ma&#8217;am, for
lettin&#8217; me off so easy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was expectin&#8217;
you&#8217;d be pretty hard on me for talkin&#8217; that way.
I&#8217;ve been wonderin&#8217; what made me say it. I
expect it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217; it so strong.
Anyway, it&#8217;s said, an&#8217; I can&#8217;t take it back. I
wouldn&#8217;t want to, for I was bound to tell you
some time, anyway. I reckon it ain&#8217;t conceit that
made me say it. I&#8217;ve liked you a heap ever since
I got hold of your picture.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that is where the picture went!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I have been hunting high and low for it. Who
gave it to you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wes Vickers, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; There was disgust
in his eyes. &#8220;I never meant to mention it, ma&#8217;am;
that was a slip of the tongue. But when I saw
the picture, I knowed I was goin&#8217; to love you.
There ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; happened yet to show that you
won&#8217;t think a lot of me, some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You frighten me,&#8221; she mocked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you ain&#8217;t none frightened,&#8221; he
laughed. &#8220;But I expect you&#8217;re some disturbed&mdash;me
sayin&#8217; what I&#8217;ve said while you&#8217;re engaged
to Masten. I&#8217;m apologizing ma&#8217;am. You be
loyal to Masten&mdash;as I know you&#8217;d be, anyway.
An&#8217; some day, when you&#8217;ve broke off with him,
I&#8217;ll come a-courtin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re sure that I&#8217;m going to break my
engagement with Masten, are you?&#8221; she queried,
trying her best to be scornful, but not succeeding
very well. &#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; that you don&#8217;t see that&#8217;s
been tellin&#8217; me, ma&#8217;am. Mebbe some day that
thing will be tellin&#8217; you the same stuff, an&#8217; then
you&#8217;ll understand,&#8221; he said enigmatically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, pressing her lips together as
though this were to be her last word on the subject;
&#8220;I have heard that the wilderness sometimes
makes people dream strange dreams, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
suppose yours is one of them.&#8221; She wheeled
her pony and sent it scampering onward toward
the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>He followed, light of heart, for while she had
taunted him, she had also listened to him, and
he felt that progress had been made.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>HAGAR&#8217;S EYES</h3>
</div>

<p>Randerson had been in no hurry to make
an attempt to catch the rustlers whose
depredations he had reported to Ruth. He had
told the men to be doubly alert to their work, and
he had hired two new men&mdash;from the Diamond
H&mdash;to replace those who had left the Flying
W. His surmise that they wanted to join Chavis
had been correct, for the two new men&mdash;whom
he had put on special duty and had been given
permission to come and go when they pleased&mdash;had
reported this fact to him. There was nothing
to do, however, but to wait, in the hope that one
day the rustlers would attempt to run cattle off
when one or more of the men happened to be in
the vicinity. And then, if the evidence against
the rustlers were convincing enough, much would
depend on the temper of himself and the men as
to whether Ruth&#8217;s orders that there should be no
hanging would be observed. There would be
time enough to decide that question if any
rustlers were caught.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>He had seen little of the Easterner during the
past two or three weeks. Masten rarely showed
himself on the range any more&mdash;to Randerson&#8217;s
queries about him the men replied that they
hadn&#8217;t seen him. But Randerson was thinking
very little about Masten as he rode through the
brilliant sunshine this afternoon. He was going
again to Catherson&#8217;s, to see Hagar. Recollections
of the change that had come over the girl
were disquieting, and he wanted to talk to her
again to determine whether she really had
changed, or whether he had merely fancied it.
</p>
<p>Far down the river he crossed at a shallow
ford, entered a section of timber, and loped
Patches slowly through this. He found a trail
that he had used several times before, when he
had been working for the Diamond H and necessity
or whim had sent him this way, and rode it,
noting that it seemed to have been used much,
lately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon old Abe&#8217;s poundin&#8217; his horses considerable.
Why, it&#8217;s right plain,&#8221; he added, after
a little reflection, &#8220;this here trail runs into the
Lazette trail, down near the ford. An&#8217; Abe&#8217;s
wearin&#8217; it out, ridin&#8217; to Lazette for red-eye. I
reckon if I was Abe, I&#8217;d quit while the quittin&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
good.&#8221; He laughed, patting Patches&#8217; shoulder.
&#8220;Shucks, a man c&#8217;n see another man&#8217;s faults
pretty far, but his own is pretty near invisible.
You&#8217;ve rode the Lazette trail a heap, too,
Patches,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when your boss was hittin&#8217;
red-eye. We ain&#8217;t growin&#8217; no angels&#8217; wings,
Patches, which would give us the right to go to
criticizin&#8217; others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Presently he began to ride with more caution,
for he wanted to surprise Hagar. A quarter of a
mile from the cabin he brought Patches to a halt
on a little knoll and looked about him. He had a
good view of the cabin in the clearing, and he
watched it long, for signs of life. He saw no such
signs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Abe&#8217;s out putterin&#8217; around, an&#8217; Hagar&#8217;s
nappin&#8217;, I reckon&mdash;or tryin&#8217; on her new dresses,&#8221;
he added as an after-thought.
</p>
<p>He was about to ride on, when a sound reached
his ears, and he drew the reins tight on Patches
and sat rigid, alert, listening.
</p>
<p>The perfect silence of the timber was unbroken.
He had almost decided that his ears had played
him a trick when the sound came again, nearer
than before&mdash;the sound of voices. Quickly and
accurately he determined from which direction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
they came, and he faced that way, watching a
narrow path that led through the timber to a grass
plot not over a hundred feet from him, from
which he was screened by some thick-growing
brush at his side.
</p>
<p>He grinned, fully expecting to see Abe and
Hagar on the path presently. &#8220;Abe&#8217;s behavin&#8217;
today,&#8221; he told himself as he waited. &#8220;I&#8217;ll sure
surprise them, if&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly he drew his breath sharply, his teeth
came together viciously, and his brows drew to a
frown, his eyes gleaming coldly underneath. For
he saw Willard Masten coming along the path,
smiling and talking, and beside him, his arm
around her waist, also smiling, but with her head
bent forward a little, was Hagar Catherson.
</p>
<p>The color slowly left Randerson&#8217;s face as he
watched. He had no nice scruples about eavesdropping
at this moment&mdash;here was no time for
manners; the cold, contemptuous rage that fought
within him was too deep and gripping to permit
of any thought that would not center about the
two figures on the path. He watched them,
screened by the brush, with the deadly concentration
of newly aroused murder-lust. Once, as he
saw them halt at the edge of the grass plot, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
he observed Masten draw Hagar close to him
and kiss her, his right hand dropped to the butt of
his pistol at his right hip, and he fingered it
uncertainly. He drew the hand away at last,
though, with a bitter, twisting smile.
</p>
<p>Five minutes later, his face still stony and
expressionless, he dismounted lightly and with
infinite care and caution led Patches away from
the knoll and far back into the timber. When he
was certain there was no chance of his being seen
or heard by Masten and Hagar, he mounted,
urged Patches forward and made a wide detour
which brought him at length to the path which
had been followed by Masten and Hagar in
reaching the grass plot. He loped the pony along
this path, and presently he came upon them&mdash;Hagar
standing directly in the path, watching
him, red with embarrassment which she was
trying hard to conceal; Masten standing on the
grass plot near her, staring into the timber opposite;
Randerson, trying to appear unconcerned and
making a failure of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Rex!&#8221; ejaculated the girl. Her hands
had been clasped in front of her; they dropped
to her sides when she saw Randerson, and her
fingers began to twist nervously into the edges of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
her apron. A deep breath, which was almost a
sigh of relief, escaped her. &#8220;I thought it was
Dad!&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Evidently Masten had likewise expected the
horseman to be her father, for at her exclamation
he turned swiftly. His gaze met Randerson&#8217;s,
his shoulders sagged a little, his eyes wavered and
shifted from the steady ones that watched him.
</p>
<p>His composure returned quickly, however, and
he smiled blandly, but there was a trace of derision
in his voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve strayed off your range, haven&#8217;t you,
Randerson?&#8221; he said smoothly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I reckon I have.&#8221; Randerson&#8217;s voice
was low, almost gentle, and he smiled mildly at
Hagar, who blushingly returned it but immediately
looked downward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect dad must be gone somewhere&mdash;that
you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; for him,&#8221; Randerson said. &#8220;I
thought mebbe I&#8217;d ketch him here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He went to Red Rock this mornin&#8217;,&#8221; said
the girl. She looked up, and this time met Randerson&#8217;s
gaze with more confidence, for his pretense
of casualness had set her fears at rest.
&#8220;Mr. Masten come over to see him, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lie came hesitatingly through her lips.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
She looked at Masten as though for confirmation,
and the latter nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Catherson is hard to catch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been over here a number of times, trying to see
him.&#8221; His voice was a note too high, and Randerson
wondered whether, without the evidence
of his eyes, he would have suspected Masten. He
decided that he would, and his smile was a trifle
grim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon Catherson is a regular dodger,&#8221; he
returned. &#8220;He&#8217;s always gallivantin&#8217; around the
country when somebody wants to see him.&#8221; He
smiled gently at Hagar, with perhaps just a little
pity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting along in the afternoon, Hagar,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Dad ought to be amblin&#8217; back here
before long.&#8221; His face grew grave at the
frightened light in her eyes when he continued:
&#8220;I reckon me an&#8217; Masten better wait for him,
so&#8217;s he won&#8217;t dodge us any more.&#8221; He cast a
glance around him. &#8220;Where&#8217;s your cayuse?&#8221;
he said to Masten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I left him down near the ford,&#8221; returned the
other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right on your way back to the Flyin&#8217; W,&#8221;
said Randerson, as though the discovery pleased
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
him. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to the Flyin&#8217; W, too, soon as
I see Catherson. I reckon, if you two ain&#8217;t got
no particular yearnin&#8217; to go prowlin&#8217; around in
the timber any longer, we&#8217;ll all go back to
Catherson&#8217;s shack an&#8217; wait for him there.
Three&#8217;ll be company, while it&#8217;d be mighty lonesome
for one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten cleared his throat and looked intently
at Randerson&#8217;s imperturbable face. Did he know
anything? A vague unrest seized Masten. Involuntarily
he shivered, and his voice was a little
hoarse when he spoke, though he attempted to
affect carelessness:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I will wait for Catherson,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I can see him tomorrow, just as well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; drawled Randerson.
&#8220;After waitin&#8217; this long, too! But I reckon you&#8217;re
right; it wouldn&#8217;t be no use waitin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll go too, I
reckon. We&#8217;ll ride to the Flyin&#8217; W together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to force my company on you,
Randerson,&#8221; laughed Masten nervously. &#8220;Besides,
I had thought of taking the river trail&mdash;back
toward Lazette, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Randerson looked at him with a cold smile.
&#8220;The Lazette trail suits me too,&#8221; he said; &#8220;we&#8217;ll
go that way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Masten looked at him again. The smile on
Randerson&#8217;s face was inscrutable. And now the
pallor left Masten&#8217;s cheeks and was succeeded by
a color that burned. For he now was convinced
and frightened. He heard Randerson speaking
to Hagar, and so gentle was his voice that it
startled him, so great was the contrast between
it and the slumbering threat in his eyes and
manner:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me an&#8217; Masten is goin&#8217; to make a short cut
over to where his horse is, Hagar; we&#8217;ve changed
our minds about goin&#8217; to the shack with you.
We&#8217;ve decided that we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to talk over that
business that he come here about&mdash;not botherin&#8217;
your dad with it.&#8221; His lips straightened at the
startled, dreading look that sprang into her eyes.
&#8220;Dad ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to know, girl,&#8221; he assured her
gravely. &#8220;I&#8217;d never tell him. You go back to
the shack an&#8217; pitch into your work, sort of forgettin&#8217;
that you ever saw Mr. Masten. For he&#8217;s
goin&#8217; away tonight, an&#8217; he ain&#8217;t comin&#8217; back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hagar covered her face with her hands and
sank into the grass beside the path, crying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, Randerson!&#8221; blustered Masten,
&#8220;what do you mean? This is going too&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>A look silenced him&mdash;choked the words in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
throat, and he turned without protest, at Randerson&#8217;s
jerk of the head toward the ford, and
walked without looking back, Randerson following
on Patches.
</p>
<p>When they reached the narrow path that led to
the crossing, just before entering the brush Randerson
looked back. Hagar was still lying in the
grass near the path. A patch of sunlight shone on
her, and so clear was the light that Randerson
could plainly see the spasmodic movement of her
shoulders. His teeth clenched tightly, and the
muscles of his face corded as they had done in the
Flying W ranchhouse the day that Aunt Martha
had told him of Pickett&#8217;s attack on Ruth.
</p>
<p>He watched silently while Masten got on his
horse, and then, still silent, he followed as Masten
rode down the path, across the river, through the
break in the canyon wall and up the slope that led
to the plains above. When they reached a level
space in some timber that fringed the river,
Masten attempted to urge his horse through it, but
was brought to a halt by Randerson&#8217;s voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get off here, Masten.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten turned, his face red with wrath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Randerson,&#8221; he bellowed; &#8220;this
ridiculous nonsense has gone far enough. I know,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
now, that you were spying on us. I don&#8217;t know
why, unless you&#8217;d selected the girl yourself&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s ag&#8217;in you too,&#8221; interrupted Randerson
coldly. &#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making a lot of fuss about the girl,&#8221;
sneered Masten. &#8220;A man&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a heap careless with words that you
don&#8217;t know the meanin&#8217; of,&#8221; said Randerson.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t raise men out here that do things like
you do. An&#8217; I expect you&#8217;re one in a million.
They all can&#8217;t be like you, back East; if they was,
the East would go to hell plenty rapid. Get off
your horse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten demurred, and Randerson&#8217;s big pistol
leaped into his hand. His voice came at the same
instant, intense and vibrant:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t make no difference to me <i>how</i> you
get off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He watched Masten get down, and then he slid
to the ground himself, the pistol still in hand, and
faced Masten, with only three or four feet of
space separating them.
</p>
<p>Masten had been watching him with wide, fearing
eyes, and at the menace of his face when he
dismounted Masten shrank back a step.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Heavens, man, do you mean to shoot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
me?&#8221; he said, the words faltering and scarcely
audible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon shootin&#8217; would be too good for you.&#8221;
Again Randerson&#8217;s face had taken on that peculiar
stony expression. Inexorable purpose was written
on it; what he was to do he was in no hurry to
be about, but it would be done in good time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never claimed to be no angel,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;m about the average, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve fell
before temptation same as other men. But I&#8217;ve
drawed the line where you&#8217;ve busted over it.
Mebbe if it was some other girl, I wouldn&#8217;t feel it
like I do about Hagar. But when I tell you that
I&#8217;ve knowed that girl for about five years, an&#8217;
that there wasn&#8217;t a mean thought in her head until
you brought your dirty carcass to her father&#8217;s
shack, an&#8217; that to me she&#8217;s a kid in spite of her
long dresses and her newfangled furbelows,
you&#8217;ll understand a heap about how I feel right
now. Get your paws up, for I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to thrash
you so bad that your own mother won&#8217;t know you&mdash;if
she&#8217;s so misfortunate as to be alive to look
at you! After that, you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to hit the breeze
out of this country, an&#8217; if I ever lay eyes on you
ag&#8217;in I&#8217;ll go gunnin&#8217; for you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>While he had been speaking he had holstered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
the pistol, unstrapped his cartridge belt and let
guns and belt fall to the ground. Then without
warning he drove a fist at Masten&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>The Easterner dodged the blow, evaded
him, and danced off, his face alight with a
venomous joy. For the dreaded guns were out
of Randerson&#8217;s reach, he was a fair match for
Randerson in weight, though Randerson towered
inches above him; he had had considerable experience
in boxing at his club in the East, and he
had longed for an opportunity to avenge himself
for the indignity that had been offered him at
Calamity. Besides, he had a suspicion that Ruth&#8217;s
refusal to marry before the fall round-up had
been largely due to a lately discovered liking for
the man who was facing him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy you&#8217;ll have your work cut out for
you, you damned meddler!&#8221; he sneered as he
went in swiftly, with a right and left, aimed at
Randerson&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>The blows landed, but seemingly had no effect,
for Randerson merely gritted his teeth and
pressed forward. In his mind was a picture of a
girl whom he had &#8220;dawdled&#8221; on his knee&mdash;a
&#8220;kid&#8221; that he had played with, as a brother
might have played with a younger sister.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE RUSTLERS</h3>
</div>

<p>At about the time Randerson was crossing the
river near the point where the path leading
to Catherson&#8217;s shack joined the Lazette trail, Ruth
Harkness was loping her pony rapidly toward
him. They passed each other within a mile, but
both were unconscious of this fact, for Randerson
was riding in the section of timber that he
had entered immediately after crossing the river,
and Ruth was concealed from his view by a
stretch of intervening brush and trees.
</p>
<p>Ruth had been worried more than she would
have been willing to admit, over the presence of
Chavis and his two men in the vicinity, and that
morning after she had questioned a puncher about
the former Flying W foreman, she had determined
to ride down the river for the purpose of making
a long distance observation of the &#8220;shack&#8221; the
puncher and Randerson had mentioned as being
inhabited by Chavis. That determination had not
been acted upon until after dinner, however, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
it was nearly two o&#8217;clock when she reached the
ford where she had passed Randerson.
</p>
<p>The puncher had told her that Chavis&#8217; shack
was about fifteen miles distant from the Flying
W ranchhouse, and situated in a little basin near
the river, which could be approached only by
riding down a rock-strewn and dangerous declivity.
She had no intention of risking the descent;
she merely wanted to view the place
from afar, and she judged that from the edge of
a plateau, which the puncher had described to
her, she would be able to see very well.
</p>
<p>When she passed the ford near the Lazette
trail, she felt a sudden qualm of misgiving, for
she had never ridden quite that far alone&mdash;the
ford was about ten miles from the ranchhouse&mdash;but
she smiled at the sensation, conquering it, and
continued on her way, absorbed in the panoramic
view of the landscape.
</p>
<p>At a distance of perhaps a mile beyond the ford
she halted the pony on the crest of a low hill and
looked about her. The country at this point was
broken and rocky; there was much sand; the line
of hills, of which the one on which her pony stood
was a part, were barren and uninviting. There
was much cactus. She made a grimace of abhorrence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
at a clump that grew near her in an arid
stretch, and then looked beyond it at a stretch of
green. Far away on a gentle slope she saw some
cattle, and looking longer, she observed a man on
a horse. One of the Flying W men, of course,
she assured herself, and felt more secure.
</p>
<p>She rode on again, following a ridge, the pony
stepping gingerly. Another half mile and she
urged the pony down into a slight depression
where the footing was better. The animal made
good progress here, and after a while they struck
a level, splotched with dry bunch-grass, which
rustled noisily under the tread of the pony&#8217;s hoofs.
</p>
<p>It was exhilarating here, for presently the level
became a slope, and the slope merged into another
level which paralleled the buttes along the river,
and she could see for miles on the other side of
the stream, a vista of plain and hills and mountains
and forest so alluring in its virgin wildness;
so vast, big, and silent a section that it awed her.
</p>
<p>When she saw the sun swimming just above the
peaks of some mountains in the dim distance, she
began to have some doubts of the wisdom of
making the trip, but she pressed on, promising herself
that she would have a brief look at the shack
and the basin, and then immediately return. She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
had expected to make much better time than she
had made. Also, she had not anticipated that a
fifteen-mile ride would tire her so. But she believed
that it was not the ride so far, but the
prospect of another fifteen-mile ride to return,
that appalled her&mdash;for she had ridden much
since her coming to the Flying W, and was rather
hardened to it. In one of his letters to her, her
uncle had stated that his men often rode sixty
miles in a day, and that he remembered one ride
of ninety miles, which a cowpuncher had made
with the same pony in twenty-two hours of straight
riding. He had told her that the tough little
plains pony could go any distance that its rider
was able to &#8220;fork&#8221; it. She believed that, for the
little animal under her had never looked tired
when she had ridden him to the ranchhouse at
the end of a hard day.
</p>
<p>But these recollections did not console her, and
she urged the pony on, into a gallop that took her
over the ground rapidly.
</p>
<p>At last, as she was swept around a bend in the
plateau, she saw spreading beneath her a little
valley, green-carpeted, beautiful. A wood rose
near the river, and at its edge she saw what she
had come to see&mdash;Chavis&#8217; shack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>And now she realized that for all the knowledge
that a look at Chavis&#8217; shack would give her, she
might as well have stayed at the Flying W. She
didn&#8217;t know just what she had expected to see
when she got here, but what she did see was
merely the building, a small affair with a flat roof,
the spreading valley itself, and several steers
grazing in it.
</p>
<p>There were no other signs of life. She got off
the pony and walked to the edge of the plateau,
discovering that the valley was much shallower
than she thought it would be, and that at her
side, to the left, was the declivity that the puncher
had told her about. She leaned over the edge
and looked at it.
</p>
<p>It was not so steep as she had expected when
listening to the puncher&#8217;s description of it. But
she thought it looked dangerous. At the point
from which she viewed it, it was not more than
fifteen or twenty feet below her. It cut into the
plateau, running far back and doubling around
toward her, and the stretch below her, that was
within range of her eyes, was almost level. The
wall of the cut on which she stood was ragged and
uneven, with some scraggly brush thrusting out
between the crevices of rocks, and about ten feet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
down was a flat rock, like a ledge, that projected
several feet out over the level below.
</p>
<p>She was about to turn, for she had seen all she
cared to see, when an impulse of curiosity urged
her to crane her neck to attempt to peer around
a shoulder of the cut where it doubled back. She
started and turned pale, not so much from fright
as with surprise, for she saw a horse&#8217;s head
projecting around the shoulder of the cut, and the
animal was looking directly at her. As she drew
back, her breath coming fast, the animal whinnied
gently.
</p>
<p>Almost instantly, she heard a man&#8217;s voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;My cayuse is gettin&#8217; tired of loafin&#8217;, I reckon.&#8221;
Ruth held her breath. The voice seemed to
come from beneath her feet&mdash;she judged that it
really had come from beneath the rock that
projected from the wall of the cut below her. And
it was Chavis&#8217; voice!
</p>
<p>Of course, he would not be talking to himself,
and therefore there must be another man with
him. At the risk of detection, and filled with an
overwhelming curiosity to hear more she kneeled
at the edge of the cut and listened intently, first
making sure that the horse she had seen could not
see her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon Linton didn&#8217;t pull it off&mdash;or them
Flyin&#8217; W guys are stickin&#8217; close to the herd,&#8221; said
another voice. &#8220;He ought to have been here an
hour ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Linton ain&#8217;t no rusher,&#8221; said Chavis. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a silence. Then Chavis spoke
again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Flyin&#8217; W stock is particular easy to run off.
Did I tell you? B&mdash;&mdash; told me&#8221;&mdash;Ruth did not
catch the name, she thought it might have
been Bennet, or Ben&mdash;&#8220;that the girl had give
orders that anyone ketched runnin&#8217; off Flyin&#8217; W
stock wasn&#8217;t to be hung!&#8221; Ruth heard him
chuckle. &#8220;Easy boss, eh, Kester?&#8221; He sneered.
&#8220;Ketch that damned Flyin&#8217; W outfit hangin&#8217; anybody!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kester was one of the men who had quit the
day that Ruth had met Randerson, when the latter
had been riding in for the money due them. It
did not surprise Ruth to discover that Kester was
with Chavis, for Randerson had told her what
might be expected of him. Linton was the other
man.
</p>
<p>Nor did it surprise Ruth to hear Chavis talking
of stealing the Flying W stock. But it angered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
her to discover that her humane principles were
being ridiculed; she was so incensed at Chavis that
she felt she could remain to hear him no longer,
and she got up, her face red, her eyes flashing, to
go to her pony.
</p>
<p>But the pony was nowhere in sight. She remembered
now, her heart sinking with a sudden,
vague fear, that she had neglected to trail the
reins over the animal&#8217;s head, as she had been
instructed to do by the puncher who had gentled
the pony for her; he had told her that no western
horse, broken by an experienced rider, would stray
with a dragging rein.
</p>
<p>She gave a quick, frightened glance around.
She could see clearly to the broken section of
country through which she had passed some time
before, and her glance went to the open miles of
grass land that stretched south of her. The pony
had not gone that way, either. Trembling from
a sudden weakness, but driven by the urge of stern
necessity, she advanced cautiously to the edge of
the cut again and looked over.
</p>
<p>Her pony was standing on the level below her,
almost in front of the rock under which had been
Chavis and Kester! It had evidently just gone
down there, for at the instant she looked over the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
edge of the cut she saw Chavis and Kester running
toward it, muttering with surprise.
</p>
<p>For one wild, awful instant, Ruth felt that she
would faint, for the world reeled around her in
dizzying circles. A cold dread that seized her
senses helped her to regain control of herself
presently, however, and scarcely breathing she
stole behind some dense weeds at the edge of the
cut, murmuring a prayer of thankfulness for their
presence.
</p>
<p>What Chavis and Kester had said upon seeing
the pony, she had not heard. But now she saw
crafty smiles on their faces; Chavis&#8217; was transfigured
by an expression that almost drew a
cry of horror from her. Through the weeds she
could see their forms, and even hear the subdued
exclamation from Chavis:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the girl&#8217;s cayuse, sure. I&#8217;d know it if I
saw it in the Cannibal islands. I reckon she&#8217;s
been snoopin&#8217; around here somewheres, an&#8217; it&#8217;s
sloped! Why, Kester!&#8221; he cried, standing erect
and drawing great, long breaths, his eyes blazing
with passion as for an instant she saw them as
they swept along the edge of the cut, &#8220;I&#8217;d swing
for a kiss from them lips of hers!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fool!&#8221; declared Kester. &#8220;Let the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
women alone! I never knowed a man to monkey
with one yet, that he didn&#8217;t get the worst of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chavis paid no attention to this remonstrance.
He seized Ruth&#8217;s pony by the bridle and began
to lead it up the slope toward the plateau. Kester
laid a restraining hand on his arm. He spoke
rapidly; he seemed to have become, in a measure,
imbued with the same passion that had taken
possession of Chavis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave the cayuse here; she&#8217;ll be huntin&#8217; for it,
directly; she&#8217;ll come right down here. Give her
time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chavis, however, while he obeyed the suggestion
about leaving the pony where it was, did
not follow Kester&#8217;s suggestion about waiting, but
began to run up the slope toward the plateau,
scrambling and muttering. And Kester, after a
short instant of silent contemplation, followed
him.
</p>
<p>Ruth no longer trembled. She knew that if
she was to escape from the two men she would
have to depend entirely upon her own wit and
courage, and in this crisis she was cool and self-possessed.
She waited until she saw the two
men vanish behind the shoulder of the cut where
she had seen the horse&#8217;s head, and then she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
clambered over the edge of the wall, grasping
some gnarled branches, and letting herself slide
quickly down. In an instant she felt her feet
come in contact with the flat rock under which
the men had been when she had first heard them
talking. It seemed a great distance to the
ground from the rock, but she took the jump
bravely, not even shutting her eyes. She landed
on all fours and pitched headlong, face down,
in the dust, but was up instantly and running
toward her pony.
</p>
<p>Seizing the bridle, she looped it through her
arm, and then, pulling at the animal, she ran to
where the horses of the two men stood, watching
her, and snorting with astonishment and fright.
With hands that trembled more than a little, she
threw the reins over their heads, so that they
might not drag, and then, using the quirt,
dangling from her wrist by a rawhide thong, she
turned their heads toward the declivity and
lashed them furiously. She watched them as
they went helter-skelter, down into the valley,
and then with a smile that might have been grim
if it had not been so quavering, she mounted her
own animal and rode it cautiously up the slope
toward the plateau.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>As she reached the plateau, her head rising
above its edge, she saw that Chavis and Kester
were a good quarter of a mile from her and
running toward some timber a few hundred
yards beyond them.
</p>
<p>With a laugh that was almost derisive, Ruth
whipped her pony and sent it flying over the
plateau at an angle that took her almost directly
away from the running men. She had been riding
only a minute or two, however, when she heard
a shout, and saw that the men had stopped and
were facing in her direction, waving their hands
at her. They looked grotesque&mdash;like jumping
jacks&mdash;in the sudden twilight that had fallen,
and she could not withhold a smile of triumph.
It did not last long, for she saw the men begin
to run again, this time toward the cut, and she
urged her pony to additional effort, fearful that
the men might gain their ponies and overtake her.
</p>
<p>And now that the men were behind her, she
squared her pony toward the trail over which
she had ridden to come here, determined to
follow it, for she felt that she knew it better than
any other.
</p>
<p>The pony ran well, covering the ground with
long, agile jumps. For about two miles she held
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
it to its rapid pace, and then, looking backward
for the first time she saw the plateau, vast, dark
and vacant, behind her, and she drew the pony
down, for she had come to the stretch of broken
country and realized that she must be careful.
</p>
<p>She shuddered as she looked at the darkening
world in front of her. Never had it seemed so
dismal, so empty, and at the same time so full of
lurking danger. The time which precedes the
onrush of darkness is always a solemn one; it
was doubly solemn to Ruth, alone, miles from
home, with a known danger behind her and unknown
dangers awaiting her.
</p>
<p>Fifteen miles! She drew a long breath as the
pony scampered along; anxiously she scanned the
plains to the south and in front of her for signs
of Flying W cattle or men. The cattle and horseman
that she had previously seen, far over on
the slope, had vanished, and it looked so dismal
and empty over there that she turned her head
and shivered.
</p>
<p>There seemed to be nothing in front of her
but space and darkness. She wondered, gulping,
whether Uncle Jepson and Aunt Martha were
worried about her. They would be, of course, for
she had never stayed like this before. But, she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
thought, with a pulse of joy, they would be lighting
the lamps presently, and when she got to the big
level beyond the ford, she would be able to see
the lights, and the sight of them would make
her feel better. She had never realized before
how companionable a horse felt, and as her pony
ran on, she began to give some attention to his
work, noting how his muscles rippled and contracted,
how his sides heaved, with what regularity
his legs moved. Involuntarily, she felt of his
shoulder&mdash;it was moist, and the muscles under
the smooth hair writhed like living things. She
laughed, almost hysterically, for the touch made
her feel that she was not alone&mdash;she was with
the most faithful of man&#8217;s friends, and she knew
that the little animal under her would do his best
for her&mdash;would run himself to death in her
service, if she insisted.
</p>
<p>She had a glorious start over her pursuers.
They would never catch her. Twice, after she
entered the broken stretch she looked back, but
could see no sign of them. She did not know that
at that moment Chavis and Kester, enraged and
disgusted over the trick she had played on them,
were riding slowly through the valley toward
their shack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>She was almost through the broken stretch
when the pony stumbled. She pulled quickly on
the reins, and the pony straightened. But
instantly she felt its forelegs stiffen, felt it slide;
the thought came to her that it must have slid on
a flat rock or a treacherous stretch of lava. It
struggled like a cat, to recover its balance, grunting
and heaving with the effort, but went down,
finally, sideways, throwing her out of the
saddle.
</p>
<p>She had anticipated the fall and had got her
feet out of the stirrups, and she alighted standing,
braced for the shock. Her left foot struck
the top of a jagged rock, slipped, doubled under
her, and she felt a sharp, agonizing pain in the
ankle. For a moment she paid no attention to
it, however, being more concerned for the pony,
but when she noted that the animal had got up,
seemingly none the worse for the fall, she suddenly
realized that the ankle pained her
terribly, and she hopped over to a flat rock and
sat on it, to examine the injury. She worked the
ankle rapidly back and forth, each movement
bringing tears to her eyes. She had almost forgotten
about her pursuers, and when she thought
of them she got up and limped toward the pony,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
which had wandered a little away from where it
had fallen.
</p>
<p>And now the pony, which had performed so
nobly for her during the miles she had ridden to
reach this spot, suddenly seemed determined to
undo all his service by yielding to a whim to avoid
capture.
</p>
<p>She tried threats, flattery, cajolery. Twice
more she hobbled painfully near him, and each
time he unconcernedly walked away. The third
time, he allowed her to come very close, and just
when she felt that success was very near, he
snorted with pretended fright, wheeled, and
slashed out with both hoofs at her and galloped
off a full quarter of a mile. She could see him
standing and looking at her, his ears erect, before
the darkness blotted him from view altogether.
</p>
<p>She tried again, groping her way painfully
over rocks, slipping, stumbling, holding her
breath from fear of snakes&mdash;but she could not
find the pony. And then, white, shaking, clammy
from her dread of the darkness, the awesome
silence, and the possibility of Chavis and Kester
finding her here, she groped blindly until she
found a big rock rising high above its fellows, and
after a struggle during which she tore the skin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
from her hands and knees, she climbed to its top
and crouched on it, shuddering and crying. And
she thought of Randerson; of his seriousness and
his earnestness when he had said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you don&#8217;t know hate or fear or
desperation.... Out here things run loose, an&#8217;
if you stay here long enough, some day you&#8217;ll meet
them an&#8217; recognize them for your own&mdash;an&#8217;
you&#8217;ll wonder how you ever got along without
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, she hated now; she hated everything&mdash;the
country included&mdash;with a bitterness that,
she felt, would never die. And she had felt fear,
too, and desperation. She felt them now, and
more, she felt a deep humility, and she felt a
genuine respect for Randerson&mdash;a respect which
more than counterbalanced her former repugnance
toward him for the killing of Pickett.
For she knew that a while ago, if she had had a
pistol with her, she would have killed Chavis and
Kester without hesitation.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE FIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>At about the time that Chavis and Kester
had discovered Ruth&#8217;s pony and had
clambered up the slope in search of the girl, the
two figures on the timber-fringed level near the
break in the canyon wall were making grotesque
shadows as they danced about in the dying sunlight.
</p>
<p>Masten&#8217;s science had served him well. He had
been able, so far, to evade many of Randerson&#8217;s
heavy blows, but some of them had landed. They
had hurt, too, and had taken some of the vigor
out of their target, though Masten was still
elusive as he circled, with feet that dragged a little,
feinting and probing for openings through
which he might drive his fists.
</p>
<p>A great many of his blows had reached their
mark also. Randerson&#8217;s face was covered with
livid lumps and welts. But he seemed not to mind
them, to be unconscious of them, for on his lips
was still the dogged smile that had reached them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
soon after the fight had started, and in his eyes
was the same look of cold deliberation and unrelenting
purpose.
</p>
<p>He had spoken no word since the fight began;
he had taken Masten&#8217;s heaviest punches without
sign or sound to indicate that they had landed,
always crowding forward, carrying the battle to
his adversary, refusing to yield a step when to
yield meant to evade punishment. Passion, deep
and gripping, had made him for the moment an
insensate automaton; he was devoid of any feeling
except a consuming desire to punish the
despoiler of his &#8220;kid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But he was holding this passion in check; he
was its master&mdash;it had not mastered him; he had
made it a vassal to his deliberation. To have unleashed
it all at once would have made him too
eager, would have weakened him. He had chosen
this punishment for Masten, and he would see
that it was sufficient.
</p>
<p>But, as Randerson had well known, Masten
was no mean opponent. He stepped in and out
rapidly, his blows lacking something in force
through his inability to set himself. But he landed
more often than Randerson; he blocked and
covered cleverly; he ducked blows that would have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
ended the fight had they struck him with their
full force.
</p>
<p>Masten had been full of confidence when the
fight started. Some of that confidence had gone
now. He was beginning to realize that he could
not beat Randerson with jabs and stinging
counters that hurt without deadening the flesh
where they struck; nor could he hope to wear the
Westerner down and finally finish him. And
with this realization came a pulse of fear. He
began to take more risks, to set himself more
firmly on his feet in order to give his blows
greater force when they landed. For he felt his
own strength waning, and he knew what the end
would be, should he no longer be able to hold
Randerson off.
</p>
<p>He went in now with a left jab, and instead of
dancing back to avoid Randerson&#8217;s counter, he
covered with the left, swiftly drawn back from
the jab, and hooked his right to Randerson&#8217;s face.
The blow landed heavily on Randerson&#8217;s jaw,
shaking him from head to foot. But he shook his
head as though to dissipate the effect of it,
and came after Masten grimly. Again Masten
tried the maneuver, and the jab went home accurately,
with force. But when he essayed to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
drive in the right, it was blocked, and Randerson&#8217;s
right, crooked, rigid, sent with the force of
a battering ram, landed fairly on Masten&#8217;s mouth,
with deadening, crushing effect.
</p>
<p>It staggered Masten, sent him back several feet,
and his legs shook under him, sagging limply.
His lips, where the blow had landed, were
smashed, gaping hideously, red-stained. Randerson
was after him relentlessly. Masten dared
not clinch, for no rules of boxing governed this
fight, and he knew that if he accepted rough and
tumble tactics he would be beaten quickly. So he
trusted to his agility, which, though waning,
answered well until he recovered from the effects
of the blow.
</p>
<p>And then, with the realization that he was
weakening, that the last blow had hurt him badly,
came to Masten the sickening knowledge that
Randerson was fighting harder than ever. He
paid no attention to Masten&#8217;s blows, not even
attempting to fend them off, but bored in, swinging
viciously. His blows were landing now; they
left deadened flesh and paralyzed muscles as
marks of their force.
</p>
<p>Masten began to give way. Half a dozen times
he broke ground, or slipped to one side or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
the other. It was unavailing. Blows were coming
at him now from all angles, ripping, tearing,
crashing blows that seemed to increase in force
as the fight went on. One of them caught Masten
just below the ear on the right side. He reeled
and went to his haunches, and dizzy, nauseated,
he sat for an instant, trying to fix the world correctly
in his vision, for it was all awry&mdash;trees,
the plains, himself&mdash;all were dancing.
Dimly he sensed the form of Randerson looming
over him. He still was able to grasp the danger
that menaced him, and reeling, he threw himself
headlong, to escape Randerson, landing on his
side on the ground, and with an inarticulate shriek
of fury, he pulled the small caliber pistol from his
hip pocket, aimed it at the shadowy form of his
adversary and pressed the trigger.
</p>
<p>And then it seemed that an avalanche had
struck him; that he was whirled along by it, then
buried under it.
</p>
<p>Evidently he had been buried for a long time,
for when he opened his eyes the dense blackness
of the Western night had descended. He felt a
dull, heavy pain in his right wrist, and he raised
it&mdash;it seemed to have been crushed. He laid
the hand down again, with a groan, and then he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
heard a voice. Looking up, he saw the shadowy
figure of his conqueror standing over him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve handed it to you pretty bad,&#8221;
said Randerson. &#8220;But you had it comin&#8217; to you.
If you hadn&#8217;t tried to play the skunk at the last
minute, you&#8217;d have got off easier. I reckon your
hand ain&#8217;t so active as it&#8217;s been&mdash;I had to pretty
near stamp it off of you&mdash;you would keep
pullin&#8217; the trigger of that pop-gun. Do you reckon
you c&#8217;n get up now, an&#8217; get on your horse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten felt himself lifted; he did not resist.
Then he felt the saddle under him; he made an
effort and steadied himself. Then, still only half
conscious he rode, reeling in the saddle, toward a
light that he saw in the distance, which, he dimly
felt, must come from the Flying W ranchhouse.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE ROCK AND THE MOONLIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>Randerson did not leave the scene of the
fight immediately. He stood for a long
time, after buckling on his belt and pistols, looking
meditatively toward the break in the canyon
beyond which was Catherson&#8217;s shack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the dresses have anything to do with
it?&#8221; he asked himself, standing there in the
darkness. &#8220;New dresses might have&mdash;puttin&#8217;
foolish notions in her head. But I reckon the
man&mdash;&#8221; He laughed grimly. He had thought
it all over before, back there on the path when he
had been talking to Masten and Hagar. He
reflected again on it now. &#8220;Lookin&#8217; it square in
the face, it&#8217;s human nature. We&#8217;ll allow that.
We&#8217;ll say a man has feelin&#8217;s. But a man ought
to have sense, too&mdash;or he ain&#8217;t a man. If
Masten was a boy, now, not realizin&#8217;, there&#8217;d
be excuses. But he&#8217;s wised up.... If his intentions
had been honorable&mdash;but he&#8217;s engaged
to Ruth, an&#8217; they couldn&#8217;t. I reckon he&#8217;ll pull his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
freight now. Catherson would sure muss him up
some.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He mounted his pony and rode toward the
Flying W ranchhouse. Halfway there he passed
Masten. The moon had risen; by its light he
could see the Easterner, who had halted his horse
and was standing beside it, watching him. Randerson
paid no heed to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinkin&#8217; it over, I reckon,&#8221; he decided, as
he rode on. Looking back, when he reached the
house, he saw that Masten was still standing
beside his horse.
</p>
<p>At the sound of hoof beats, Uncle Jepson came
out on the porch and peered at the rider. Randerson
could see Aunt Martha close behind him.
Uncle Jepson was excited. He started off the
porch toward Randerson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Randerson, mother!&#8221; he called shrilly
back to Aunt Martha, who was now on the porch.
</p>
<p>In a brief time Randerson learned that Ruth
had gone riding&mdash;alone&mdash;about noon, and had
not returned. Randerson also discovered that
the girl had questioned a puncher who had ridden
in&mdash;asking him about Chavis&#8217; shack and the
basin. Randerson&#8217;s face, red from the blows that
had landed on it, paled quickly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon she&#8217;s takin&#8217; her time about comin&#8217;
in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mebbe her cayuse has broke a leg&mdash;or
somethin&#8217;.&#8221; He grinned at Uncle Jepson.
&#8220;I expect there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to worry
about. I&#8217;ll go look for her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He climbed slowly into the saddle, and with a
wave of the hand to the elderly couple rode his
pony down past the bunkhouse at a pace that was
little faster than a walk. He urged Patches to
slightly greater speed as he skirted the corral
fence, but once out on the plains he loosened the
reins, spoke sharply to the pony and began to
ride in earnest.
</p>
<p>Patches responded nobly to the grim note in
his master&#8217;s voice. With stretching neck and
flying hoofs he swooped with long, smooth undulations
that sent him, looking like a splotched
streak, splitting the night. He ran at his own
will, his rider tall and loose in the saddle, speaking
no further word, but thinking thoughts that
narrowed his eyes, made them glint with steely
hardness whenever the moonlight struck them,
and caused his lips to part, showing the clenched
teeth between them, and shoved his chin forward
with the queer set that marks the fighting man.
</p>
<p>For he did not believe that Ruth&#8217;s pony had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
broken a leg. She had gone to see Chavis&#8217; shack,
and Chavis&mdash;
</p>
<p>One mile, two, three, four; Patches covered
them in a mad riot of recklessness. Into depressions,
over rises, leaping rocks and crashing
through chaparral clumps, scaring rattlers,
scorpions, toads, and other denizens to wild
flight, he went, with not a thought for his own or
his rider&#8217;s safety, knowing from the ring in his
master&#8217;s voice that speed, and speed alone, was
wanted from him.
</p>
<p>After a five mile run he was pulled down. He
felt the effects of the effort, but he was well
warmed to his work now and he loped, though
with many a snort of impatience and toss of the
head, by which he tried to convey to his master
his eagerness to be allowed to have his will.
</p>
<p>On the crest of a hill he was drawn to a halt,
while Randerson scanned the country around him.
Then, when the word came again to go, he was
off with a rush and a snort of delight, as wildly
reckless as he had been when he had discovered
what was expected of him.
</p>
<p>They flashed by the ford near the Lazette
trail; along a ridge, the crest of which was hard
and barren, making an ideal speedway; they sank
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
into a depression with sickening suddenness,
went out of it with a clatter, and then went careening
over a level until they reached a broken stretch
where speed would mean certain death to both.
</p>
<p>Patches was determined to risk it, but suddenly
he was pulled in and forced to face the other
way. And what he saw must have made him
realize that his wild race was ended, for he
deflated his lungs shrilly, and relaxed himself for
a rest.
</p>
<p>Randerson had seen her first. She was sitting
on the top of a gigantic rock not more than fifty
feet from him; she was facing him, had evidently
been watching him; and in the clear moonlight
he could see that she was pale and frightened&mdash;frightened
at him, he knew, fearful that he might
not be a friend.
</p>
<p>This impression came to him simultaneously
with her cry&mdash;shrill with relief and joy: &#8220;Oh,
it&#8217;s Patches! It&#8217;s Randerson!&#8221; And then she
suddenly stiffened and stretched out flat on the
top of the rock.
</p>
<p>He lifted her down and carried her, marveling
at her lightness, to a clump of bunch-grass near
by, and worked, trying to revive her, until she
struggled and sat up. She looked once at him,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
her eyes wide, her gaze intent, as though she
wanted to be sure that it was really he, and then
she drew a long, quavering breath and covered
her face with her hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it was horrible!&#8221; She uncovered
her face and looked up at him. &#8220;Why,&#8221;
she added, &#8220;I have been here since before dark!
And it must be after midnight, now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about nine. Where&#8217;s your horse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone,&#8221; she said dolorously. &#8220;He fell&mdash;over
there&mdash;and threw me. I saw Chavis&mdash;and
Kester&mdash;over on the mesa. I thought they
would come after me, and I hurried. Then my
pony fell. I&#8217;ve hurt my ankle&mdash;and I couldn&#8217;t
catch him&mdash;my pony, I mean; he was too
obstinate&mdash;I could have killed him! I couldn&#8217;t
walk, you know&mdash;my ankle, and the snakes&mdash;and
the awful darkness, and&mdash;Oh, Randerson,&#8221;
she ended, with a gulp of gratitude, &#8220;I never was
so glad to see you&mdash;anybody&mdash;in my life!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it <i>was</i> kind of lonesome for you out
here alone with the snakes, an&#8217; the dark, an&#8217;
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was over her scare now, he knew&mdash;as
he was over his fears for her, and he grinned with
a humor brought on by a revulsion of feeling.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon mebbe the snakes would have
bothered you some,&#8221; he added, &#8220;for they&#8217;re
natural mean. But I reckon the moon made such
an awful darkness on purpose to scare you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you joke about it?&#8221; she demanded
resentfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said with quick
contrition. &#8220;You see, I was glad to find you.
An&#8217; you&#8217;re all right now, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; she said, quickly forgiving. &#8220;I
suppose I <i>am</i> a coward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, ma&#8217;am, I reckon you ain&#8217;t. Anybody
sittin&#8217; here alone, a woman, especial, would
likely think a lot of curious thoughts. They&#8217;d
seem real. I reckon it was your ankle, that kept
you from walkin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It hurts terribly,&#8221; she whispered, and she
felt of it, looking at him plaintively. &#8220;It is so
swollen I can&#8217;t get my boot off. And the leather
seems like an iron band around it.&#8221; She looked
pleadingly at him. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you please take it
off?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His embarrassment was genuine and deep.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I reckon I can, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he told her.
&#8220;But I ain&#8217;t never had a heap of experience&mdash;&#8221; His
pause was eloquent, and he finished lamely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
&#8220;with boots&mdash;boots, that is, that was on
swelled ankles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it necessary to have experience?&#8221; she
returned impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I reckon not, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He knelt beside
her and grasped the boot, giving it a gentle
tug. She cried out with pain and he dropped the
boot and made a grimace of sympathy. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
mean to hurt you, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you didn&#8217;t&#8221;&mdash;peevishly. &#8220;Oh,&#8221;
she added as he took the boot in hand again, this
time giving it a slight twist; &#8220;men are <i>such</i>
awkward creatures!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I reckon they are, ma&#8217;am. That is,
one, in particular. There&#8217;s times when I can&#8217;t
get my own boots on.&#8221; He grinned, and she
looked icily at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get hold of it just above the ankle, please,&#8221;
she instructed evenly and drew the hem of her
skirt tightly. &#8220;There!&#8221; she added as he seized
the limb gingerly, &#8220;now pull!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He did as he had been bidden. She shrieked
in agony and jerked the foot away, and he stood
up, his face reflecting some of the pain and
misery that shone in hers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he sympathized. &#8220;Over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
at the Diamond H, one of the boys got his leg
broke, last year, ridin&#8217; an outlaw, or tryin&#8217; to ride
him, which ain&#8217;t quite the same thing&mdash;an&#8217; we
had to get his boot off before we could set the
break. Why, ma&#8217;am; we had to set on his head
to keep him from scarin&#8217; all the cattle off the
range, with his screechin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked at him with eyes that told him
plainly that no one was going to sit on <i>her</i> head&mdash;and
that she would &#8220;screech&#8221; if she chose.
And then she spoke to him with bitter sarcasm:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps if you <i>tried</i> to do something, instead
of standing there, telling me something that
happened <i>ages</i> ago, I wouldn&#8217;t have to sit here
and endure this awful m-m-misery!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The break in her voice brought him on his
knees at her side. &#8220;Why, I reckon it <i>must</i> hurt
like the devil, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He looked around helplessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got something that you might
take it off with?&#8221; she demanded tearfully.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got a knife?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He reddened guiltily. &#8220;I clean forgot it
ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He laughed with embarrassment. &#8220;I
expect I&#8217;d never do for a doctor, ma&#8217;am; I&#8217;m so
excited an&#8217; forgetful. An&#8217; I recollect, now that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
you mention it, that we had to cut Hiller&#8217;s boot
off. That was the man I was tellin&#8217; you about.
He&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; she said with heavy resignation,
&#8220;I suppose you simply <i>must</i> talk! Do you <i>like</i>
to see me suffer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, shucks, I feel awful sorry for you,
ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;ll sure hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>While he had been speaking he had drawn out
his knife, and with as much delicacy as the circumstances
would permit, he accomplished the
destruction of the boot. Then, after many
admonitions for him to be careful, and numerous
sharp intakings of her breath, the boot was
withdrawn, showing her stockinged foot, puffed
to abnormal proportions. She looked at it
askance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it is b-broken?&#8221; she asked
him, dreading.
</p>
<p>He grasped it tenderly, discovered that the
ankle moved freely, and after pressing it in
several places, looked up at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s broke, ma&#8217;am. It&#8217;s a bad
sprain though, I reckon. I reckon it ought to
be rubbed&mdash;so&#8217;s to bring back the blood that
couldn&#8217;t get in while the boot was on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>The foot was rubbed, he having drawn off the
stocking with as much delicacy as he had exhibited
in taking off the boot. And then while Randerson
considerately withdrew under pretense of
looking at Patches, the stocking was put on
again. When he came back it was to be met with
a request:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please find my pony and bring
him back?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He started again for
Patches, but halted and looked back at her. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t be scared again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. And then: &#8220;But you&#8217;ll hurry,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon.&#8221; He was in the saddle quickly,
loping Patches to the crest of a hill near by in
hopes of getting a view of the recreant pony.
He got a glimpse of it, far back on the plains near
some timber, and he was about to shout the news
to Ruth, who was watching him intently, when
he thought better of the notion and shut his lips.
</p>
<p>Urging Patches forward, he rode toward
Ruth&#8217;s pony at a moderate pace. Three times
during the ride he looked back. Twice he was
able to see Ruth, but the third time he had
swerved so that some bushes concealed him from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
her. He was forced to swerve still further to
come up with the pony, and he noted that Ruth
would never have been able to see her pony from
her position.
</p>
<p>It was more than a mile to where the animal
stood, and curiously, as though to make amends
for his previous bad behavior to Ruth, he came
trotting forward to Randerson, whinnying gently.
</p>
<p>Randerson seized the bridle, and grinned at
the animal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I ought to lam you a-plenty, you
miserable deserter,&#8221; he said severely, &#8220;runnin&#8217;
away from your mistress that-a-way. Is that the
way for a respectable horse to do? You&#8217;ve got
her all nervous an&#8217; upset&mdash;an&#8217; she sure roasted
me. Do you reckon there&#8217;s any punishment that&#8217;d
fit what you done? Well, I reckon! You come
along with me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leading the animal, he rode Patches to the
edge of the timber. There, unbuckling one end
of the reins from the bit ring, he doubled them,
passed them through a gnarled root, made a
firm knot and left the pony tied securely. Then
he rode off and looked back, grinning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lost, you sufferin&#8217; runaway. Only
you don&#8217;t know it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>He loped Patches away and made a wide
detour of the mesa, making sure that he appeared
often on the sky line, so that he would be seen
by Ruth. At the end of half an hour he rode
back to where the girl was standing, watching
him. He dismounted and approached her, standing
before her, his expression one of grave worry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That outlaw of yours ain&#8217;t anywhere in sight,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I reckon he&#8217;s stampeded back
to the ranchhouse. You sure you ain&#8217;t seen him
go past here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;unless he went way around,
just after it got dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s what he must have done.
Some horses is plumb mean. But you can&#8217;t walk,
you know,&#8221; he added after a silence; &#8220;I reckon
you&#8217;ll have to ride Patches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have to walk, then,&#8221; she objected.
&#8220;And that wouldn&#8217;t be fair!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Walkin&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t bother me, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He
got Patches and led him closer. She looked at
the animal, speculatively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think he could carry both of us?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>He scrutinized Patches judicially. A light,
which she did not see, leaped into his eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t think of that. I reckon he
could, ma&#8217;am. Anyway, we can try it, if you want
to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led Patches still closer. Then, with much
care, he lifted Ruth and placed her in the saddle,
mounting behind her. Patches moved off.
</p>
<p>After a silence which might have lasted while
they rode a mile, Ruth spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My ankle feels very much easier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Randerson,&#8221; she said, after they had gone on
a little ways further; &#8220;I beg your pardon for
speaking to you the way I did, back there. But
my foot <i>did</i> hurt terribly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure. I expect I deserved to get
roasted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again there was a silence. Ruth seemed to be
thinking deeply. At a distance that he tried to
keep respectful, Randerson watched her, with
worshipful admiration, noting the graceful disorder
of her hair, the wisps at the nape of
her neck. The delicate charm of her made him
thrill with the instinct of protection. So strong
was this feeling that when he thought of her pony,
back at the timber, guilt ceased to bother him.
</p>
<p>Ruth related to him the conversation she had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
overheard between Chavis and Kester, and he
smiled understandingly at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you reckon you feel as tender toward
them now as you did before you found that out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;It made me
angry to hear them talk like that. But as for
hanging them&mdash;&#8221; She shivered. &#8220;There were
times, tonight, though, when I thought hanging
would be too good for them,&#8221; she confessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll shape up real western&mdash;give you
time,&#8221; he assured. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be ready to take
your own part, without dependin&#8217; on laws to do it
for you&mdash;laws that don&#8217;t reach far enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I shall ever get your viewpoint,&#8221;
she declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Pickett was bound to try to
get me. Do you think that if I&#8217;d gone to the
sheriff at Las Vegas, an&#8217; told him about Pickett,
he&#8217;d have done anything but poke fun at me?
An&#8217; that word would have gone all over the
country&mdash;that I was scared of Pickett&mdash;an&#8217; I&#8217;d
have had to pull my freight. I had to stand my
ground, ma&#8217;am. Mebbe I&#8217;d have been a hero if
I&#8217;d have let him shoot me, but I wouldn&#8217;t have
been here any more to know about it. An&#8217; I&#8217;m
plumb satisfied to be here, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come to hear about me not
getting home?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rode in to see Catherson. I couldn&#8217;t see
him&mdash;because he wasn&#8217;t there. Then I come on
over to the ranchhouse, an&#8217; Uncle Jepson told me
about you not comin&#8217; in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Mr. Masten at the ranchhouse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He hesitated. Then he spoke slowly. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t see him there, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She evidently wondered why it had not been
Masten that had come for her.
</p>
<p>They were near the house when she spoke
again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have an accident today, Randerson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he asked to gain time, for
he knew that the moonlight had been strong
enough, and that he had been close enough to her,
to permit her to see.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your face has big, ugly, red marks on it, and
the skin on your knuckles is all torn,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Patches throwed me twice, comin&#8217; after you,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he lied. &#8220;I plowed up the ground
considerable. I&#8217;ve never knowed Patches to be
so unreliable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned in the saddle and looked full at him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
&#8220;That is strange,&#8221; she said, looking ahead again.
&#8220;The men have told me that you are a wonderful
horseman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The men was stretchin&#8217; the truth, I reckon,&#8221;
he said lightly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; she returned earnestly; &#8220;I thank
you very much for coming for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She said nothing more to him until he helped
her down at the edge of the porch at the ranchhouse.
And then, while Uncle Jepson and Aunt
Martha were talking and laughing with pleasure
at her return, she found time to say, softly to him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t blame you so much&mdash;about
Pickett. I suppose it was necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said gratefully.
</p>
<p>He helped her inside, where the glare of the
kerosene lamps fell upon him. He saw Uncle
Jepson looking at him searchingly; and he caught
Ruth&#8217;s quick, low question to Aunt Martha, as he
was letting her gently down in a chair:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Willard?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He came in shortly after dark,&#8221; Aunt Martha
told her. &#8220;Jep was talking to him, outside. He
left a note for you. He told Jep that he was
going over to Lazette for a couple of weeks, my
dear.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>Randerson saw Ruth&#8217;s frown. He also saw
Aunt Martha looking intently through her
glasses at the bruises on his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, boy,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;what has
happened to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Randerson reddened. It was going to be
harder for him to lie to Aunt Martha than to
Ruth. But Ruth saved him the trouble.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Randerson was thrown twice, riding out to
get me,&#8221; she explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Throwed twice, eh?&#8221; said Uncle Jepson to
Randerson, when a few minutes later he followed
the range boss out on the porch. He grinned at
Randerson suspiciously. &#8220;Throwed twice, eh?&#8221;
he repeated. &#8220;Masten&#8217;s face looks like some
one had danced a jig on it. Huh! I cal&#8217;late that
if you was throwed twice, Masten&#8217;s horse must
have <i>drug</i> him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t tellin&#8217; <i>her</i>!&#8221; suggested Randerson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell her anything <i>you</i> want to tell her,
my boy,&#8221; whispered Uncle Jepson. &#8220;An&#8217; if I
don&#8217;t miss my reckonin&#8217;, she&#8217;ll <i>listen</i> to you, some
day.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE RUNAWAY COMES HOME</h3>
</div>

<p>Masten&#8217;s note to Ruth contained merely
the information that he was going to
Lazette, and that possibly he might not return for
two weeks. He hinted that he would probably
be called upon to go to Santa Fe on business, but
if so he would apprise her of that by messenger.
He gave no reason for his sudden leave-taking,
or no explanation of his breach of courtesy in not
waiting to see her personally. The tone of the
note did not please Ruth. It had evidently been
written hurriedly, on a sheet of paper torn from
a pocket notebook. That night she studied it
long, by the light from the kerosene lamp in her
room, and finally crumpled it up and threw it from
her. Then she sat for another long interval, her
elbows on the top of the little stand that she used
as a dressing table, her chin in her hands, staring
with unseeing eyes into a mirror in front of her&mdash;or
rather, at two faces that seemed to be reflected
in the glass: Masten&#8217;s and Randerson&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>Next morning she got downstairs late, to find
breakfast over and Randerson gone. Later in the
morning she saw Uncle Jepson waving a hand to
her from the corral, and she ran down there, to
find her pony standing outside the fence, meek
and docile. The bridle rein, knotted and broken,
dangled in the dust at his head.
</p>
<p>She took up the end with the knot in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been tied!&#8221; she exclaimed. She showed
Uncle Jepson the slip knot. And then she became
aware of Aunt Martha standing beside her, and
she showed it to her also. And then she saw a
soiled blue neckerchief twisted and curled in the
knot, and she examined it with wide eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Randerson&#8217;s!&#8221; she declared, in
astonishment. &#8220;How on earth did it get here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And now her face crimsoned, for illumination
had come to her. She placed the neckerchief
behind her, with a quick hope that her relatives
had not seen it, nor had paid any attention to her
exclamation. But she saw Uncle Jepson grin
broadly, and her face grew redder with his
words:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cal&#8217;late the man who lost that blue
bandanna wasn&#8217;t a tol&#8217;able piece away when that
knot was tied.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jep Coakley, you mind your own business!&#8221;
rebuked Aunt Martha sharply, looking severely
at Uncle Jepson over the rims of her spectacles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mind him, honey,&#8221; she consoled,
putting an arm around the girl as Uncle Jepson
went away, chuckling. &#8220;Why, girl,&#8221; she went on,
smiling at Ruth&#8217;s crimson face, &#8220;you don&#8217;t blame
him, do you? If you don&#8217;t know he likes you,
you&#8217;ve been blind to what I&#8217;ve been seeing for
many days. Never mention to him that you know
he tied the pony, dear. For he&#8217;s a gentleman, in
spite of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And obediently, though with cheeks that reddened
many times during the process, and laughter
that rippled through her lips occasionally,
Ruth washed the neckerchief, folded it, to make
creases like those which would have been in it
had its owner been wearing it, then crumpled it,
and stole to Randerson&#8217;s room when she was sure
that he was not there, and placed the neckerchief
where its owner would be sure to find it.
</p>
<p>She was filled with a delightful dread against
the day when he would discover it, for she felt
that he might remember where he had lost it, and
thus become convinced that she knew of his
duplicity. But many days passed and he did not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
come in. She did not know that on his way out
to join the outfit the next morning he had noticed
that he had lost the neckerchief, and that he
remembered it flapping loose around his neck
when he had gone toward the timber edge for her
pony. He had searched long for it, without success,
of course, and had finally ridden away,
shaking his head, deeply puzzled over its disappearance.
</p>
<p>Nor did Ruth know that on the day she had
discovered the neckerchief dangling from the
knot, Aunt Martha had spoken again to Uncle
Jep concerning it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jep Coakley,&#8221; she said earnestly; &#8220;you like
your joke, as well as any man. But if I ever hear
of you mentioning anything to Randerson about
that bandanna, I&#8217;ll tweak your nose as sure as
you&#8217;re alive!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<a name='XVI_TWO_ARE_TAUGHT_LESSONS' id='XVI_TWO_ARE_TAUGHT_LESSONS'></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>TWO ARE TAUGHT LESSONS</h3>
</div>

<p>There was one other thing that Ruth did
not know&mdash;the rage that dwelt in Randerson&#8217;s
heart against Chavis and Kester. He had
shown no indication of it when she had related to
him the story of her adventure with the men, nor
did he mention it to any of his associates. There
had been a time in his life when he would have
brought the men to a quick and final accounting,
for their offense was one that the laws governing
human conduct in this country would not condone;
but he was not the man he had been before the
coming of Ruth; her views on the taking of human
life&mdash;no matter what the provocation&mdash;were
barriers that effectively restrained his desires.
</p>
<p>Yet he could not permit Kester and Chavis to
think they could repeat the offense with impunity.
That would be an indication of impotence, of
servile yielding to the feminine edict that had
already gone forth, and behind which Chavis and
his men were even now hiding&mdash;the decree of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
Flying W owner that there should be no taking
of human life. His lips twisted crookedly as on
the morning of the day following his adventure
with Ruth and the recreant pony he mounted his
own animal and rode away from the outfit without
telling any of them where he was going. Two
or three hours later, in a little basin near the plateau
where Ruth had overheard the men talking,
Chavis and Kester were watching the crooked
smile; their own faces as pale as Randerson&#8217;s,
their breath swelling their lungs as the threat of
impending violence assailed them; their muscles
rippling and cringing in momentary expectation of
the rapid movement they expected&mdash;and dreaded;
their hearts laboring and pounding. For they saw
in the face of this man who had brought his pony
to a halt within ten feet of them a decision to
adhere to the principles that had governed him
all his days, and they knew that a woman&#8217;s order
would not stay the retributive impulse that was
gleaming in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get to an understandin&#8217; before we quit
here,&#8221; he said, his cold, alert eyes roving over
them. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made one break, an&#8217; you&#8217;re gettin&#8217;
out of it because my boss ain&#8217;t dead stuck on
attendin&#8217; funerals. I reckon you know I ain&#8217;t got
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
no such nice scruples, an&#8217; a funeral more or less
won&#8217;t set so awful heavy on my conscience.
There&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be more mourners requisitioned
in this country damned sudden if women ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to be allowed range rights. I ain&#8217;t passin&#8217; around
no more warnin&#8217;s, an&#8217; you two is talkin&#8217; mighty
sudden or the mourners will be yowlin&#8217;. What&#8217;s
the verdict?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chavis sighed. &#8220;We wasn&#8217;t meanin&#8217; no harm,&#8221;
he apologized, some color coming into his face
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you?&#8221; Randerson&#8217;s level look confused
Kester.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t travelin&#8217; that trail no more,&#8221; he promised,
his eyes shifting. He knew as well as Chavis
that it was the only way. A word, spoken with
a hint of belligerence, a single hostile movement,
would have precipitated the clash they knew Randerson
had come to force&mdash;a clash which they
knew would end badly for them. For Randerson
had chosen his position when halting Patches&mdash;it
was strategic, and they knew his fingers were itching
for the feel of his guns.
</p>
<p>They saw the crooked smile fade from his lips;
they curved with cold, amused contempt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not runnin&#8217; no risks to speak of, eh?&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
drawled. &#8220;Well, get goin&#8217;!&#8221; He lounged in
the saddle, watching them as they rode away, not
looking back. When they reached the far slope
of the basin he turned Patches and sniffed disgustedly.
Five minutes later he was at the crest
of the back slope, riding toward the outfit, miles
away.
</p>
<p>It was an hour later that he observed a moving
spot on the sky line. The distance was great, but
something familiar in the lines of the figure&mdash;when
he presently got near enough to see that the
blot was a pony and rider&mdash;made his blood leap
with eager anticipation; and he spoke sharply to
Patches, sending him forward at a brisk lope.
</p>
<p>He had seen some cattle near the rider; he had
passed them earlier in the morning&mdash;lean, gaunt
range steers that would bother a fast pony in a
run if thoroughly aroused.
</p>
<p>He saw that the rider had halted very close to
one of the steers, and a look of concern flashed
into his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She oughtn&#8217;t to do that!&#8221; he muttered. Unconsciously,
his spurs touched Patches&#8217; flanks, and
the little animal quickened his pace.
</p>
<p>Randerson did not remove his gaze from the
distant horse and rider. He rode for a quarter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
of a mile in silence, his muscles slowly tensing as
he watched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s she doin&#8217; now?&#8221; he demanded of the
engulfing space, as he saw the rider swing around
in the saddle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; he snapped an instant later; &#8220;she&#8217;s
gettin&#8217; off her horse!&#8221; He raised his voice in a
shout, that fell flat and futile on the dead desert
air, and he leaned forward in the saddle and drove
the spurs deep as he saw the range steer nearest
the rider raise its head inquiringly and look toward
the rider&mdash;for she had dismounted and was walking
away from her horse at an angle that would
take her very close to the steer.
</p>
<p>Patches was running now, with the cat-like
leaps peculiar to him, and his rider was urging
him on with voice and spur and hand, his teeth set,
his eyes burning with anxiety.
</p>
<p>But the girl had not seen him. She was still
moving away from her horse; too far away from
it to return if the steer decided to charge her, and
Randerson was still fully half a mile distant.
</p>
<p>He groaned audibly as he saw the steer take a
few tentative steps toward her, his head raised,
tail erect, his long horns glinting in the white sunlight.
Randerson knew the signs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he whispered; &#8220;can&#8217;t she see
what that steer is up to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed she did, for she had halted and was
facing the animal. For an instant there was no
movement in the vast realm of space except the
terrific thunder of Patches&#8217; hoofs as they spurned
the hard alkali level over which he was running;
the squeaking protests of the saddle leather, and
Randerson&#8217;s low voice as he coaxed the pony to
greater speed. But Patches had reached the limit
of effort, was giving his rider his last ounce of
strength, and he closed the gap between himself
and the girl with whirlwind rapidity.
</p>
<p>But it seemed he would be too late. The girl
had sensed her danger. She had caught the
stealthy movement of the steer; she had glimpsed
the unmistakable malignance of his blood-shot
eyes, and had stood for an instant in the grip of
a dumb, paralyzing terror. She had dismounted
to gather some yellow blossoms of soap-weed that
had looked particularly inviting from the saddle,
and too late she had become aware of the belligerent
actions of the steer.
</p>
<p>She realized now that she was too far from her
pony to reach it in case the steer attacked her, but
in the hope of gaining a few steps before the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
charge came she backed slowly, edging sidelong
toward the pony.
</p>
<p>She gained a considerable distance in this manner,
for during the first few seconds of the movement
the steer seemed uncertain and stood,
swinging its head from side to side, pawing the
sand vigorously.
</p>
<p>The girl was thankful for the short respite, and
she made the most of it. She had retreated perhaps
twenty-five or thirty feet when the steer
charged, bolting toward her with lowered head.
</p>
<p>She had gone perhaps thirty or forty feet when
Patches reached the scene. The girl saw the blur
he made as he flashed past her&mdash;he had cut between
her and the steer&mdash;so close to her that the
thunder of his hoofs roared deafening in her ears,
and the wind from his passing almost drew her
off her balance as amazed, stunned, nerveless, she
halted. She caught a glimpse of Randerson&#8217;s profile
as he swept into a circle and threw his rope.
There must be no missing&mdash;there was none. The
sinuous loop went out, fell over the steer&#8217;s head.
Thereafter there was a smother of dust in which
the girl could see some wildly waving limbs. Outside
of the smother she saw the pony swing off
for a short distance and stiffen its legs. The rope
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
attached to the pommel of the saddle grew taut
as a bow string; there was an instant of strained
suspense during which the pony&#8217;s back arched until
the girl thought it must surely break. It was over
in an instant, though every detail was vividly impressed
upon the girl&#8217;s mind. For the cold terror
that had seized her had fled with the appearance
of Patches&mdash;she knew there could be no danger
to her after that.
</p>
<p>She watched the steer fall. He went down
heavily, the impetus of his charge proving his
undoing; he struck heavily on head and shoulder,
grunting dismally, his hind quarters rising in the
air, balancing there for an infinitesimal space and
then following his head.
</p>
<p>The rope stretched tighter; the girl saw Patches
putting a steady pull on it. The loop had fallen
around the steer&#8217;s neck; she heard the animal
cough for breath once, then its breath was cut off.
</p>
<p>In this minute the girl&#8217;s chief emotion was one
of admiration for the pony. How accurate its
movements in this crisis! How unerring its judgment!
For though no word had been spoken&mdash;at
least the girl heard none&mdash;the pony kept the
rope taut, bracing against its burden as Randerson
slid out of the saddle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s interest left the pony and centered
on its rider. Randerson was running toward the
fallen steer, and though Ruth had witnessed this
operation a number of times since her coming to
the Flying W, she had never watched it with quite
the interest with which she watched it now. It
was all intensely personal.
</p>
<p>Randerson had drawn a short piece of rope from
a loop on the saddle when he had dismounted. It
dangled from his hand as he ran toward the steer.
In an instant he was bending over the beast, working
at its hoofs, drawing the forehoofs and one
hind hoof together, lashing them fast, twining
the rope in a curious knot that, the girl knew from
experience, would hold indefinitely.
</p>
<p>Randerson straightened when his work was
finished, and looked at Ruth. The girl saw that
his face was chalk white. But his voice was sharp,
and it rang like the beat of a hammer upon metal:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get on your horse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no refusing that voice, and Ruth
turned and ran toward her pony, with something
of the confusion and guilt that overtakes a recreant
child scolded by its parent. She was scarcely in
the saddle when she turned to watch Randerson.
</p>
<p>He was pulling the loop from the steer&#8217;s head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
He coiled it, with much deliberation, returned to
Patches and hung the rope from its hook. Then
he walked slowly back to the steer.
</p>
<p>The latter had been choked to unconsciousness,
but was now reviving. With a quick jerk Randerson
removed the rope from its hoofs, retreating
to Patches and swinging into the saddle, watching
the movements of the steer.
</p>
<p>The steer had got to its feet and stood with
legs braced in sharp outward angles, trembling, its
great head rolling from side to side, lowered
almost to the dust, snorting breath into its lungs.
</p>
<p>The girl was fascinated, but she heard Randerson&#8217;s
voice again, flung at her this time:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away from here&mdash;quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She jerked on the reins, and the pony, wise with
the wisdom of experience, knowing the danger
that portended, bolted quickly, carrying her some
distance before she succeeded in halting him.
</p>
<p>When she turned to look back, there was a
dust cloud near the spot where the steer had lain.
In the cloud she saw the steer, Patches, and Randerson.
Patches and the steer were running&mdash;Patches
slightly in advance. The pony was racing,
dodging to the right and left, pursuing a
zig-zag course that kept the steer bothered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>As the girl watched she found a vicious rage
stealing over her, directed against the steer. Why
didn&#8217;t Randerson kill the beast, instead of running
from it in that fashion? Somehow, she did
not like to see Randerson in that role; it was far
from heroic&mdash;it flavored of panic; it made her
think of the panic that had gripped her a few
minutes before, when she had retreated from the
steer.
</p>
<p>She watched the queer race go on for a few
minutes, and then she saw an exhibition of roping
that made her gasp. From a point fifteen or
twenty feet in advance of the steer, Randerson
threw his rope. He had twisted in the saddle,
and he gave the lariat a quick flirt, the loop running
out perpendicularly, like a rolling hoop, and
not more than a foot from the ground, writhing,
undulating, the circle constricting quickly, sinuously.
The girl saw the loop topple as it neared
the steer&mdash;it was much like the motion of a hoop
falling. It met one of the steer&#8217;s hoofs as it was
flung outward; it grew taut; the rope straightened
and Patches swung off to the right at an acute
angle. He did not brace his legs, this time. This
was a different game. He merely halted, turning
his head and watching, with a well-I&#8217;ve-done-it-now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
expression of the eyes that would have brought a
smile to the girl&#8217;s face at any other time.
</p>
<p>Again it was over in an instant; for the second
time the steer turned a somersault. Again there
followed a space during which there was no
movement.
</p>
<p>Then Randerson slacked the rope. It seemed
to Ruth that Patches did this of his own accord.
The steer scrambled to its feet, hesitated an instant,
and then lunged furiously toward the tormenting
horse and rider.
</p>
<p>Patches snorted; Ruth was certain it was with
disgust. He leaped&mdash;again the girl thought Randerson
had no hand in the movement&mdash;directly
toward the enraged steer, veering sharply as he
neared it, and passing to its rear. For the third
time the rope grew taut, and this time the pony
braced itself and the steer went down with a thud
that carried clearly and distinctly to the girl.
</p>
<p>She thought the beast must be fatally injured,
and felt that it richly deserved its fate. But after
a period, during which Patches wheeled to face
the beast, Randerson grinning coldly at it, the
steer again scrambled to its feet.
</p>
<p>This time it stood motionless, merely trembling
a little. The fear of the rope had seized it; this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
man-made instrument was a thing that could not
be successfully fought. That, it seemed to the
girl, was the lesson the steer had been taught from
its experience. That it was the lesson Randerson
had set out to teach the animal, the girl was certain.
It explained Randerson&#8217;s seeming panic;
it made the girl accuse herself sharply for doubting
him.
</p>
<p>She watched the scene to its conclusion. The
steer started off, shaking its head from side to side.
Plainly, it wanted no more of this sort of work;
the fight had all been taken out of it. Again the
pony stiffened, and again the steer went down with
a thud. This time, while it struggled on the
ground, Randerson gave the rope a quick flirt,
making undulation that ran from his hand to the
loop around the steer&#8217;s leg, loosening it. And
when the beast again scrambled to its feet it
trotted off, free, head and tail in the air, grunting
with relief.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later Randerson loped Patches
toward her, coiling his rope, a grin on his face.
He stopped before her, and his grin broadened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Range steers are sort of peculiar, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he said gently. &#8220;They&#8217;re raised like that. They
don&#8217;t ever see no man around them unless he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
forkin&#8217; his pony. No cowpuncher with any sense
goes to hoofin&#8217; it around a range steer&mdash;it ain&#8217;t
accordin&#8217; to the rules. Your range steer ain&#8217;t used
to seein&#8217; a man walkin&#8217;. On his pony he&#8217;s safe&mdash;nine
times out of ten. The other time a range
steer will tackle a rider that goes to monkeyin&#8217;
around him promiscuous. But they have to be
taught manners, ma&#8217;am&mdash;the same as human
bein&#8217;s. That scalawag will recognize the rope
now, ma&#8217;am, the same as a human outlaw will
recognize the rope&mdash;or the law. Of course both
will be outlaws when there&#8217;s no rope or no law
around, but&mdash;Why, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he laughed&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
gettin&#8217; right clever at workin&#8217; my jaw, ain&#8217;t I?
Are you headin&#8217; back to the Flyin&#8217; W? Because if
you are, I&#8217;d be sort of glad to go along with you&mdash;if
you&#8217;ll promise you won&#8217;t go to galivantin&#8217;
around the country on foot no more. Not that
<i>that</i> steer will tackle you again, ma&#8217;am&mdash;he&#8217;s been
taught <i>his</i> lesson. But there&#8217;s others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed and thanked him. As they rode
she considered his subtle reference to the law and
the rope, and wondered if it carried any personal
significance to anyone. Twice she looked at him
for evidence of that, but could gain nothing from
his face&mdash;suffused with quiet satisfaction.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE TARGET</h3>
</div>

<p>Earlier in the morning, Ruth had watched
Uncle Jepson and Aunt Martha ride away
in the buckboard toward Lazette. She had stood
on the porch, following them with her eyes until
the buckboard had grown dim in her vision&mdash;a
mere speck crawling over a sun-scorched earth,
under a clear white sky in which swam a sun that
for days had been blighting growing things. But
on the porch of the ranchhouse it was cool.
</p>
<p>Ruth was not cool. When the buckboard had
finally vanished into the distance, with nothing left
of it but a thin dust cloud that spread and
disintegrated and at last settled down, Ruth
walked to a rocker on the porch and sank into it,
her face flushed, her eyes glowing with eager expectancy.
</p>
<p>A few days before, while rummaging in a
wooden box which had been the property of her
uncle, William Harkness, she had come upon
another box, considerably smaller, filled with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
cartridges. She had examined them thoughtfully,
and at last, with much care and trepidation, had
taken one of them, found Uncle Harkness&#8217; big
pistol, removed the cylinder and slipped the
cartridge into one of the chambers. It had fitted
perfectly. Thereafter she had yielded to another
period of thoughtfulness&mdash;longer this time.
</p>
<p>A decision had resulted from those periods, for
the day before, when a puncher had come in from
the outfit, on an errand, she had told him to send
Randerson in to the ranchhouse to her, on the
following day. And she was expecting him now.
</p>
<p>She had tried to dissuade Uncle Jep and Aunt
Martha from making the trip to Lazette today,
but, for reasons which she would not have
admitted&mdash;and did not admit, even to herself&mdash;she
had not argued very strongly. And she had
watched them go with mingled regret and satisfaction;
two emotions that persisted in battling
within her until they brought the disquiet that
had flushed her cheeks.
</p>
<p>It was an hour before Randerson rode up to
the edge of the porch, and when Patches came
to a halt, and her range boss sat loosely in the
saddle, looking down at her, she was composed,
even though her cheeks were still a little red.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You sent for me, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the employee speaking to his &#8220;boss.&#8221;
He was not using the incident of a few nights
before to establish familiarity between them; his
voice was low, deferential. But Willard Masten&#8217;s
voice had never made her feel quite as she felt
at this moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I sent for you,&#8221; she said, smiling calmly&mdash;trying
to seem the employer but getting something
into her voice which would not properly
belong there under those circumstances. She told
herself it was not pleasure&mdash;but she saw his eyes
flash. &#8220;I have found some cartridges, and I want
you to teach me how to shoot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at her with eyes that narrowed with
amusement, after a quick glint of surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I c&#8217;n teach you. Are you figurin&#8217;
that there&#8217;s some one in this country that you don&#8217;t
want here any more?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect to shoot anybody.
But I have decided that as long as I have
made up my mind to stay here and run the Flying
W, I may as well learn to be able to protect myself&mdash;if
occasion arises.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a heap sensible. You c&#8217;n never tell
when you&#8217;ll have to do some shootin&#8217; out here.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
Not at men, especial,&#8221; he grinned, &#8220;but you&#8217;ll
run across things&mdash;a wolf, mebbe, that&#8217;ll get
fresh with you, or a sneakin&#8217; coyote that&#8217;ll kind
of make the hair raise on the back of your neck,
not because you&#8217;re scared of him, but because you
know his mean tricks an&#8217; don&#8217;t admire them, or
a wildcat, or a hydrophobia polecat, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he
said, with slightly reddening cheeks; &#8220;but
mostly, ma&#8217;am, I reckon you&#8217;ll like shootin&#8217; at
side-winders best. Sometimes they get mighty
full of fight, ma&#8217;am&mdash;when it&#8217;s pretty hot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will it take you to teach me to
shoot?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends, ma&#8217;am. I reckon I could show
you how to pull the trigger in a jiffy. That would
be a certain kind of shootin&#8217;. But as for showin&#8217;
you how to hit somethin&#8217; you shoot at, why, that&#8217;s
a little different. I&#8217;ve knowed men that practiced
shootin&#8217; for years, ma&#8217;am, an&#8217; they couldn&#8217;t hit a
barn if they was inside of it. There&#8217;s others that
can hit most anything, right handy. They say it&#8217;s
all in the eye an&#8217; the nerves, ma&#8217;am&mdash;whatever
nerves are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any nerves, I suppose, or you
wouldn&#8217;t speak of them that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean that I go to hollerin&#8217; an&#8217; jumpin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
around when somethin&#8217; happens, why I ain&#8217;t got
any. But I&#8217;ve seen folks with nerves, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was looking directly at her when he spoke,
his gaze apparently without subtlety. But she
detected a gleam that seemed far back in his
eyes, and she knew that he referred to her actions
of the other night.
</p>
<p>She blushed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you would remind
me of <i>that</i>,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t, ma&#8217;am. I didn&#8217;t mention any
names. But of course, a woman&#8217;s got nerves;
they can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course men are superior,&#8221; she taunted.
</p>
<p>She resisted an inclination to laugh, for she
was rather astonished to discover that man&#8217;s disposition
to boast was present in this son of the
wilderness. Also, she was a little disappointed
in him.
</p>
<p>But she saw him redden.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t braggin&#8217;, ma&#8217;am. Take them on an
average, an&#8217; I reckon woman has got as much
grit as men. But they show it different. They&#8217;re
quicker to imagine things than men. That makes
them see things where there ain&#8217;t anything to see.
A man&#8217;s mother is always a woman, ma&#8217;am, an&#8217;
if he&#8217;s got any grit in him he owes a lot of it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
to her. I reckon I owe more to my mother than
to my father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His gaze was momentarily somber, and she
felt a quick, new interest in him. Or had she felt
this interest all along&mdash;a desire to learn something
more of him than he had expressed?
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might get off your horse and sit in the
shade for a minute. It is hot, you&#8217;ve had a long
ride, and I am not quite ready to begin shooting,&#8221;
she invited.
</p>
<p>He got off Patches, led him to the shade of
the house, hitched him, and then returned to the
porch, taking a chair near her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Martha says you were born here,&#8221;
Ruth said. &#8220;Have you always been a cowboy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A flash that came into his eyes was concealed
by a turn of the head. So she had asked Aunt
Martha about him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember ever bein&#8217; anything else.
As far back as I c&#8217;n recollect, there&#8217;s been cows
hangin&#8217; around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you traveled any?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To Denver, Frisco, Kansas City. I was in
Utah, once, lookin&#8217; over the Mormons. They&#8217;re
a curious lot, ma&#8217;am. I never could see what on
earth a man wanted half a dozen wives for. One
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
can manage a man right clever. But half a dozen!
Why, they&#8217;d be pullin&#8217; one another&#8217;s hair out,
fightin&#8217; over him! One would be wantin&#8217; him to
do one thing, an&#8217; another would be wantin&#8217; him
to do another. An&#8217; between them, the man would
be goin&#8217; off to drown himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But a woman doesn&#8217;t always manage her
husband,&#8221; she defended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t she, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he said gently, no guile
in his eyes. &#8220;Why, all the husbands I&#8217;ve seen
seemed to be pretty well managed. You can see
samples of it every day, ma&#8217;am, if you look
around. Young fellows that have acted pretty
wild when they was single, always sort of steady
down when they&#8217;re hooked into double harness.
They go to actin&#8217; quiet an&#8217; subdued-like&mdash;like
they&#8217;d lost all interest in life. I reckon it must
be their wives managin&#8217; them, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pity, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she said, her chin
lifting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The men seem to like it, ma&#8217;am. Every day
there&#8217;s new ones makin&#8217; contracts for managers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose <i>you</i> will never sacrifice yourself?&#8221;
she asked challengingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t time, yet, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he returned, looking
straight at her, his eyes narrowed, with little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
wrinkles in the corners. &#8220;I&#8217;m waitin&#8217; for you to
tell Masten that you don&#8217;t want to manage him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t talk about that, please,&#8221; she said
coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we won&#8217;t, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sat looking at him, trying to be coldly critical,
but not succeeding very well. She was trying
to show him that there was small hope of him
ever realizing his desire to have her &#8220;manage&#8221;
him, but she felt that she did not succeed in that
very well either. Perplexity came into her eyes
as she watched him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is it that you don&#8217;t like Willard
Masten?&#8221; she asked at length. &#8220;Why is it that
he doesn&#8217;t like you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His face sobered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t recollect to have
said anything about Masten, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t like him, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A direct answer was required. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said
simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon mebbe you&#8217;d better ask Masten,&#8221; he
returned, his voice expressionless. Then he looked
at her with an amused grin. &#8220;If it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to take
you any time to learn to shoot, I reckon we&#8217;d
better begin.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>She got up, went into the house for the pistol
and cartridges, and came out again, the weapon
dangling from her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; he said, when he saw the pistol,
comparing its huge bulk to the size of the hand
holding it, &#8220;you&#8217;ll never be able to hold it, when
it goes off. You ought to have a smaller one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jep says this ought to stop anything it
hits,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;That is just what I want
it to do. If I shoot anything once, I don&#8217;t want
to have to shoot again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re right bloodthirsty, ma&#8217;am.
But I expect it&#8217;s so big for you that you won&#8217;t be
able to hit anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you,&#8221; she said, confidently. &#8220;Where
shall we go to shoot? We shall have to have a
target, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a movin&#8217; one,&#8221; he said gleefully. &#8220;An&#8217;
I ain&#8217;t aimin&#8217; to hold it for you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until you are asked,&#8221; she retorted,
defiantly. &#8220;Perhaps I may be a better shot than
you think!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked resentfully at him, but followed him
as he went out near the pasture fence, taking
with him a soap box that he found near a shed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
and standing it up behind a post, first making
sure there were no cattle within range in the
direction that the bullets would take. Then he
stepped off twenty paces, and when she joined
him he took the pistol from her hands and loaded
it from the box. He watched her narrowly as
she took it, and she saw the concern in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I have used a revolver before,&#8221; she told
him, &#8220;not so large a one as this, of course. But
I know better than to point it at myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you do, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; His hand went out
quickly and closed over hers, for she had been
directing the muzzle of the weapon fairly at his
chest. &#8220;You ought never point it at anybody
that you don&#8217;t want to shoot,&#8221; he remonstrated
gently.
</p>
<p>He showed her how to hold the weapon, told
her to stand sideways to the target, with her right
arm extended and rigid, level with the shoulder.
</p>
<p>He took some time at this; three times after
she extended her arm he seemed to find it necessary
to take hold of the arm to rearrange its
position, lingering long at this work, and squeezing
the pistol hand a little too tightly, she thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go to pullin&#8217; the trigger too fast or
too hard,&#8221; he warned; &#8220;a little time for the first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
shot will save you shootin&#8217; again, mebbe&mdash;until
you get used to it. She&#8217;ll kick some, but you&#8217;ll get
onto that pretty quick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She pulled the trigger, and the muzzle of the
pistol flew upward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that target feels pretty safe, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he said dryly. &#8220;But that buzzard up there will be
pullin&#8217; his freight&mdash;if he&#8217;s got any sense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She fired again, her lips compressed determinedly.
At the report a splinter of wood
flew from the top of the post. She looked at him
with an exultant smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; he told her, grinning; &#8220;you&#8217;ll
be hittin&#8217; the soap box, next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did hit it at the fourth attempt, and her
joy was great.
</p>
<p>For an hour she practiced, using many cartridges,
reveling in this new pastime. She hit the
target often, and toward the end she gained such
confidence and proficiency that her eyes glowed
proudly. Then, growing tired, she invited him
to the porch again, and until near noon they
talked of guns and shooting.
</p>
<p>Her interest in him had grown. His interest
in her had always been deep, and the constraint
that had been between them no longer existed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>At noon she went into the house and prepared
luncheon, leaving him sitting on the porch alone.
When she called Randerson in, and he took a
chair across from her, she felt a distinct embarrassment.
It was not because she was there alone
with him, for he had a right to be there; he was
her range boss and his quarters were in the house;
he was an employee, and no conventions were
being violated. But the embarrassment was there.
</p>
<p>Did Randerson suspect her interest in him?
That question assailed her. She studied him, and
was uncertain. For his manner had not changed.
He was still quiet, thoughtful, polite, still
deferential and natural, with a quaintness of
speech and a simplicity that had gripped her, that
held her captive.
</p>
<p>But her embarrassment fled as the meal progressed.
She forgot it in her interest for him. She
questioned him again; he answered frankly. And
through her questions she learned much of his
past life, of his hopes and ambitions. They were
as simple and natural as himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been savin&#8217; my money, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he told
her. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to own a ranch of my own, some
day. There&#8217;s fellows that blow in all their wages
in town, not thinkin&#8217; of tomorrow. But I quit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
that, quite a while ago. I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; out for
tomorrow. It&#8217;s curious, ma&#8217;am. Fellows will
try to get you to squander your money, along with
their own, an&#8217; if you don&#8217;t, they&#8217;ll poke fun at
you. But they&#8217;ll respect you for not squanderin&#8217;
it, like they do. I reckon they know there ain&#8217;t
any sense to it.&#8221; Thus she discovered that there
was little frivolity in his make-up, and pleasure
stirred her. And then he showed her another side
of his character&mdash;his respect for public opinion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I ain&#8217;t stingy, ma&#8217;am. I reckon I&#8217;ve
proved it. There&#8217;s a difference between bein&#8217;
careful an&#8217; stingy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you prove it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He grinned at her. &#8220;Why, I ain&#8217;t mentionin&#8217;,&#8221;
he said gently.
</p>
<p>But she had heard of his generosity&mdash;from
several of the men, and from Hagar Catherson.
She mentally applauded his reticence.
</p>
<p>She learned that he had read&mdash;more than she
would have thought, from his speech&mdash;and that
he had profited thereby.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Books give the writer&#8217;s opinion of things,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If you read a thoughtful book, you
either agree with the writer, or you don&#8217;t,
accordin&#8217; to your nature an&#8217; understandin&#8217;. None
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
of them get things exactly right, I reckon, for no
man can know everything. He&#8217;s got to fall down,
somewhere. An&#8217; so, when you read a book, you&#8217;ve
got to do a heap of thinkin&#8217; on your own hook,
or else you&#8217;ll get mistaken ideas an&#8217; go to gettin&#8217;
things mixed up. I like to do my own thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you always right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, ma&#8217;am, no. I&#8217;m scarcely ever
right. I&#8217;ll get to believin&#8217; a thing, an&#8217; then along
will come somethin&#8217; else, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll have to start all
over again. Or, I&#8217;ll talk to somebody, an&#8217; find
that they&#8217;ve got a better way of lookin&#8217; at a thing.
I reckon that&#8217;s natural.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did not go out to shoot again. Instead,
they went out on the porch, and there, sitting in
the shade, they talked until the sun began to swim
low in the sky.
</p>
<p>At last he got up, grinning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done a heap of loafin&#8217; today, ma&#8217;am.
But I&#8217;ve certainly enjoyed myself, talkin&#8217; to you.
But if you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to try to hit the target any
more, I reckon I&#8217;ll be ridin&#8217; back to the outfit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She got up, too, and held out her hand to him.
&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You have made the
day very short for me. It would have been
lonesome here, without aunt and uncle.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I saw them goin&#8217;,&#8221; he informed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; she continued, smiling, &#8220;I am going
to ask you to come again, very soon, to teach me
more about shooting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He still held her hand.
And now he looked at it with a blush, and dropped
it gently. Her face reddened a little too, for now
she realized that he had held her hand for quite
a while, and she had made no motion to withdraw
it. Their eyes met eloquently. The gaze held
for an instant, and then both laughed, as though
each had seen something in the eyes of the other
that had been concealed until this moment. Then
Ruth&#8217;s drooped. Randerson smiled and stepped
off the porch to get his pony.
</p>
<p>A little later, after waving his hand to Ruth
from a distance, he rode away, his mind active,
joy in his heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a knowin&#8217; horse, Patches,&#8221; he said
confidentially to the pony. &#8220;If you are, what do
you reckon made her ask so many questions?&#8221;
He gulped over a thought that came to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She was shootin&#8217; at the target, Patches,&#8221; he
mused. &#8220;But do you reckon she was aimin&#8217; at
me?&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE GUNFIGHTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Red Owen, foreman of the Flying W in
place of Tom Chavis, resigned, was
stretched out on his blanket, his head propped up
with an arm, looking at the lazy, licking flames of
the campfire. He was whispering to Bud Taylor,
named by Randerson to do duty as straw boss in
place of the departed Pickett, and he was referring
to a new man of the outfit who had been
hired by Randerson about two weeks before
because the work seemed to require the services
of another man, and he had been the only
applicant.
</p>
<p>The new man was reclining on the other side of
the fire, smoking, paying no attention to any of
the others around him. He was listening, though,
to the talk, with a sort of detached interest, a half
smile on his face, as though his interest were that
of scornful amusement.
</p>
<p>He was of medium height, slender, dark. He
was taciturn to the point of monosyllabic conversation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
and the perpetual, smiling sneer on his
face had gotten on Red Owen&#8217;s nerves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since he&#8217;s joined the outfit, he&#8217;s opened his
yap about three times a day&mdash;usual at grub
time, when if a man loosens up at all, he&#8217;ll loosen
up then,&#8221; Red told Taylor, glaring his disapproval.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea that I&#8217;ve seen the cuss
somewheres before, but I ain&#8217;t able to place
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His mug looks like he was soured on the
world&mdash;especial himself. If I had a twistin&#8217;
upper lip like that, I&#8217;d sure plant some whiskers
on it. A mustache, now, would hide a lot of the
hyena in him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Owen stared meditatively at the new man
through the flames. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said expressionlessly,
&#8220;a mustache would make him look a whole
lot different.&#8221; He was straining his mental
faculties in an effort to remember a man of his
acquaintance who possessed a lower lip like that of
the man opposite him, eyes with the same expression
in them, and a nose that was similar. He
did not succeed, for memory was laggard, or his
imagination was playing him a trick. He had
worried over the man&#8217;s face since the first time
he had seen it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>He heaved a deep breath now, and looked perplexedly
into the flames. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a word that
gits onto the end of your tongue when your brain-box
ain&#8217;t got sense enough to shuck it out,&#8221; he
remarked, lowly. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll git it, some time&mdash;if
I don&#8217;t go loco frettin&#8217; about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you figger on gettin&#8217;&mdash;a new job?&#8221;
asked Taylor, who had been sinking into a nap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Snakes!&#8221; sneered Owen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank yu&#8217;, I don&#8217;t want &#8217;em,&#8221; grinned Taylor
with ineffable gentleness, as he again closed his
eyes.
</p>
<p>Owen surveyed him with cold scorn. Owen&#8217;s
temper, because of his inability to make his memory
do his bidding, was sadly out of order. He
had been longing for days to make the new man
talk, that he might be enabled to sharpen his
memory on the man&#8217;s words.
</p>
<p>He studied the man again. He had been
studying him all day, while he and some more of
the men had worked the cattle out of some timber
near the foothills, to the edge of the basin&mdash;where
they were now camped. But the face was
still elusive. If he could only get the man to talking,
to watch the working of that lower lip!
</p>
<p>His glance roved around the fire. Seven men,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
besides the cook&mdash;asleep under the wagon&mdash;and
Randerson, were lying around the fire in
positions similar to his own. Randerson, the one
exception, was seated on the edge of the chuck
box, its canvas cover pushed aside, one leg
dangling, his elbow resting on the other.
</p>
<p>Randerson had been rather silent for the past
few days&mdash;since he had ridden in to the ranchhouse,
and he had been silent tonight, gazing
thoughtfully at the fire. Owen&#8217;s gaze finally
centered on the range boss. It rested there for
a time, and then roved to the face of the new
man&mdash;Dorgan, he called himself. Owen started,
and his chin went forward, his lips straightening.
For he saw Dorgan watching Randerson with a
bitter sneer on his lips, his eyes glittering coldly
and balefully!
</p>
<p>Evil intent was written largely here&mdash;evil
intent without apparent reason for it. For the
man was a stranger here; Randerson had done
nothing&mdash;to Owen&#8217;s knowledge&mdash;to earn
Dorgan&#8217;s enmity; Randerson did not deliberately
make enemies. Owen wondered if Dorgan were
one of those misguided persons who take offense
at a look unknowingly given, or a word, spoken
during momentary abstraction.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>Owen had disliked Dorgan before; he hated
him now. For Owen had formed a deep attachment
for Randerson. There was a determination
in his mind to acquaint the range boss with his
suspicions concerning Dorgan&#8217;s expression, and he
got up, after a while, and took a turn around the
campfire in the hope of attracting Randerson&#8217;s
attention.
</p>
<p>Randerson paid no attention to him. But
through the corners of his eyes, as he passed
Dorgan, Owen noted that the man flashed a quick,
speculative glance at him. But Owen&#8217;s determination
had not lessened. &#8220;If he&#8217;s suspicious of
me, he&#8217;s figgerin&#8217; on doin&#8217; some dog&#8217;s trick to
Wrecks. I&#8217;m puttin&#8217; Wrecks wise a few, an&#8217; if
Dorgan don&#8217;t like it, he c&#8217;n go to blazes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He walked to the rear of the chuck box and
stood within half a dozen feet of Randerson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Figger we&#8217;ve got &#8217;em all out of the timber?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>There was no answer from Randerson. He
seemed absorbed in contemplation of the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;W-r-e-c-k-s!&#8221; bawled Owen, in a voice that
brought every man of the circle upright, to look
wildly around. Taylor was on his feet, his hair
bristling, the pallor of mingled fear, astonishment,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
and disgust on his face. Owen grinned sardonically
at him. &#8220;Lay down an&#8217; turn over, you
wall-eyed gorilla!&#8221; admonished Owen. He
turned his grin on the others. &#8220;Can&#8217;t a man gas
to the boss without all you yaps buttin&#8217; in?&#8221; he
demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What for are you-all a-yowlin&#8217; that-a-way
for?&#8221; questioned a gentle-voiced Southerner
reproachfully. &#8220;I was just a-dreamin&#8217; of rakin&#8217;
in a big pot in a cyard game. An&#8217; now you&#8217;ve
done busted it up.&#8221; He sank disgustedly to his
blanket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks he&#8217;s a damned coyote,&#8221; said a
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re thinkin&#8217; it&#8217;s a yowl,&#8221; said another.
&#8220;But you&#8217;ve got him wrong. He&#8217;s a jackass, come
a-courtin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man can&#8217;t get no sleep at all, scarcely,&#8221;
grumbled another.
</p>
<p>But Owen had accomplished his purpose. For
during the exchange of amenities Randerson had
answered him&mdash;without turning, though:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you wantin&#8217;, Red?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You figger we&#8217;ve got &#8217;em all out of the
timber?&#8221; repeated Owen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks.&#8221; Randerson&#8217;s voice was rich with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
mirth. &#8220;Why, I reckon. Unless you was
figgerin&#8217; to use a fine-toothed comb. Why, the
boys was all a-nappin&#8217;, Red,&#8221; he added gently.
</p>
<p>He did not look around, so that Owen might
give him the warning wink that would have put
him on his guard. Owen would have tapped him
on the shoulder, but glancing sidelong, he saw
Dorgan watching him, and he did not. A ripple
of scornful laughter greeted Randerson&#8217;s reply,
and with a sneering glance around, Owen again
sought his blanket.
</p>
<p>The reception that had been accorded his effort
had made him appear ridiculous, he knew. It
would be days before the outfit would cease referring
to it.
</p>
<p>He stretched himself out on the blanket, but
after a few moments of reflection, he sat up,
doggedly. He had been imagining all sorts of
dire things that Dorgan might have in mind. He
had a presentiment of impending trouble, and so
deep was it that his forehead was damp with
perspiration.
</p>
<p>Several of the men, disturbed by Owen, had
sat up, and were smoking and talking, and when
he heard one of the men, named Blair, refer to
a gunman, Watt Kelso, who had formerly graced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
Lazette with his presence, a light leaped into
Owen&#8217;s eyes, his teeth came together with a snap,
his lips formed into straight lines, and he drew
a slow, deep breath. For that was the word that
had eluded him&mdash;Kelso! And Kelso&mdash;how
plain and simple it seemed to him now&mdash;Kelso
was Dorgan, sitting opposite him now! Kelso
minus his mustache, looking much different than
when he had seen him last, but Kelso, just the
same&mdash;undeniably Kelso!
</p>
<p>So great was Owen&#8217;s excitement over this discovery
that he was forced to lie down and turn his
back to the fire for fear that Kelso might look at
him and thus discover that he was recognized.
</p>
<p>As he lay there, his brain yielded to a riot of
speculation. What was Kelso doing here? Why
had he come, minus the mustache, assuming the
name, Dorgan? What meant his glances at
Randerson?
</p>
<p>He provided an explanation presently. Memory
drew a vivid picture for him. It showed him
a saloon in Lazette, some card tables, with men
seated around them. Among the men were Kelso
and Randerson. Randerson had been a mere
youth. Kelso and Randerson were seated
opposite each other, at the same table. Kelso
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
had been losing&mdash;was in bad temper. He had
charged Randerson with cheating. There had
been words, and then Kelso had essayed to draw
his pistol. There was a scuffle, a shot, and Kelso
had been led away with a broken arm, broken by
Randerson&#8217;s bullet&mdash;blaspheming, and shouting
threats at Randerson. And now, after years of
waiting, Kelso had come to carry out his threats.
It was all plain to Owen, now. And with the
knowledge, Owen&#8217;s excitement abated and he sat
up, coldly observant, alert, to watch and listen.
</p>
<p>For, while Owen had been thinking, Blair had
continued to talk of Watt Kelso, of his deeds and
his personality. And Owen saw that for the first
time since joining the outfit, Kelso seemed interested
in the talk around him. He was watching
Blair with narrowed, glittering eyes, in which
Owen could see suspicion. It was as though he
were wondering if Blair knew that the man of
whom he spoke now was at that minute sitting
close to him, listening. But presently, Owen
became convinced that Kelso thought not, for the
suspicion in the gunman&#8217;s eyes changed to cold,
secret amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kelso&#8217;s pulled his freight from Lazette,&#8221;
declared Blair, during the course of his talk. &#8220;It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
likely he&#8217;ll drift somewhere where he ain&#8217;t so well
known. It got to be pretty hard pickin&#8217; for him
around here&mdash;folks fight shy of him. But he
was sure a killer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Blair paused. &#8220;I reckon I might mention a
man that he didn&#8217;t kill,&#8221; said a man who lay near
Blair. &#8220;An&#8217; he wanted to, mighty bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re wantin&#8217; to know,&#8221; returned Blair.
&#8220;He must have been a high-grade gun-slinger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man nodded toward Randerson, who
apparently was not listening to this conversation.
There was a subdued chuckle from the man, and
grunts of admiration or skepticism from the
others. Owen&#8217;s gaze was fixed on Kelso; he saw
the latter&#8217;s eyes gleam wickedly. Yes, that was
it, Owen saw now; the recollection of his defeat
at Randerson&#8217;s hands still rankled in the gunman&#8217;s
mind. Owen saw him glance covertly at
Randerson, observed his lips curl.
</p>
<p>One of the other men saw the glance also. Not
having the knowledge possessed by Owen, the
man guffawed loudly, indicating the gunman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorgan ain&#8217;t swallerin&#8217; your yarn about
Randerson puttin&#8217; a kink in Kelso,&#8221; he said to
Blair.
</p>
<p>Randerson turned, a mild grin on his face.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
&#8220;You fellows quit your soft-soapin&#8217; about that
run-in with Kelso,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t any
compliments due me. I was pretty lucky to get
out of that scrape with a whole hide. They told
me Kelso&#8217;s gun got snagged when he was tryin&#8217;
to draw it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So then, Randerson <i>had</i> been listening, despite
his apparent abstraction. And Owen sat rigid
when he saw the gunman look coldly at Randerson
and clear his throat.
</p>
<p>Plainly, if Kelso had been awaiting an opportunity
to take issue with Randerson, it was now!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you was mighty lucky.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a sneer in the words, and malevolence
in the twist of his lips as his voice came
through them.
</p>
<p>A flat, dead silence followed the speech. Every
man held the position in which he had been when
the gunman had spoken; nothing but their eyes
moved, and these were directed from Randerson
to the gunman and back again, questioningly,
expectantly. For in the hearts of the men who
had been talking until now there had been no
thought of discord; they had spoken without
rancor. But hostility, cold, premeditated, had
been in the new man&#8217;s speech.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>Randerson moved his head slightly, and he
was looking straight into Kelso&#8217;s eyes. Kelso
had moved a little; he was now sitting on his
saddle, having shifted his position when Blair
had begun to talk, and the thumb of his right hand
was hooked in his cartridge belt just above the
holster of his pistol.
</p>
<p>Randerson&#8217;s face was expressionless. Only his
eyes, squinted a little, with a queer, hard glint in
them, revealed any emotion that might have
affected him over Kelso&#8217;s words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Dorgan,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;I was mighty
lucky.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kelso&#8217;s lips curved into a slow, contemptuous
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ve always been lucky,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; that you&#8217;ve fell into a soft place
here, that you ain&#8217;t fit to fill!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again a silence fell, dread, premonitory. It
was plain to every man of the outfit, awake and
listening, that Dorgan had a grievance&mdash;whether
real or imaginary, it made little difference&mdash;and
that he was determined to force trouble.
Only Owen, apparently, knowing the real state
of affairs, knew that the reference to Randerson&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
inefficiency was a mere pretext. But that violence,
open, deadly, was imminent, foreshadowed by
Dorgan&#8217;s word, every man knew, and all sat tense
and pale, awaiting Randerson&#8217;s reply.
</p>
<p>They knew, these men, that it was not Randerson&#8217;s
way to force trouble&mdash;that he would avoid
it if he could do so without dishonor. But could
he avoid it now? The eyes that watched him saw
that he meant to try, for a slow, tolerant smile
appeared on his lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re plumb excited&mdash;Owen
wakin&#8217; you up out of your sleep like he did,&#8221;
said Randerson. &#8220;But,&#8221; he added, the smile
chilling a little, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t askin&#8217; no man to work
for me, if he ain&#8217;t satisfied. You can draw your
time tomorrow, if it don&#8217;t suit you here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m drawin&#8217; it now!&#8221; sneered the gunman.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t workin&#8217; for no pussy-kitten specimen
which spends his time gallivantin&#8217; around the
country with a girl, makin&#8217; believe he&#8217;s bossin&#8217;,
when&mdash;&#8221; Here he added something that made
the outfit gasp and stiffen.
</p>
<p>As he neared the conclusion of the speech, his
right hand fell to his gun-holster. Owen had
been watching him, and at the beginning of the
movement he shouted a warning:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look out, Wrecks!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had been afraid to tell Randerson that it
was Kelso who was facing him, for fear that the
information, bursting upon Randerson quickly,
would disconcert him.
</p>
<p>But Randerson had been watching, understanding
the drift of the gunman&#8217;s words. And when
he saw the shoulder of his gun-arm move, his
own right hand dropped, surely, swiftly. Kelso&#8217;s
gun had snagged in its holster years before. It
came freely enough now. But its glitter at his
side was met by the roar and flame spurt of Randerson&#8217;s
heavy six, the thumb snap on the hammer
telling of the lack of a trigger spring, the position
of the weapon indicating that it had not been
drawn from its holster.
</p>
<p>Apparently not a man in the outfit had noticed
this odd performance, though they had been held
with dumb astonishment over the rapidity with
which it had been executed. But they saw the
red, venomous streak split the night; they heard
the gunman&#8217;s gurgling gasp of amazement, and
they watched, with ashen faces, while he dropped
his weapon, sagged oddly forward and tumbled
headlong into the sand near the fire. Then
several of them sprang forward to drag him back.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>It had seemed that none of the men had noticed
that Randerson had seemed to shoot his pistol
while it was still in the holster. One, however,
had noticed. It was Red Owen. And while the
other men were pulling the gunman back from
the fire, Owen stepped close to Randerson, lifted
the holster, and examined it quickly. He dropped
it, with a low exclamation of astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wonderin&#8217;&mdash;Holy smoke! It&#8217;s a
phony holster, fixed on the gun to look like the
real thing! An&#8217; swung from the belt by the
trigger guard! Lord, man! Did you know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That Dorgan was Kelso?&#8221; said Randerson,
with a cold smile. &#8220;I reckon. I knowed him the
day he asked for a job. An&#8217; I knowed what he
come for&mdash;figurin&#8217; on settlin&#8217; that grudge.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Randerson and Owen started toward the gunman,
to determine how badly he had been hit;
they were met by Blair. There was amazement
and incredulity in the man&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s goin&#8217; to cash in&mdash;quick,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You got him, pretty nearly proper&mdash;just over
the heart. But, but, he says he&#8217;s Watt Kelso!
An&#8217; that that eastern dude, Masten, sent him
over here&mdash;payin&#8217; him five hundred cold, to
perforate you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>Randerson ran to where Kelso lay, gasping and
panting for breath. He knelt beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You talkin&#8217; straight, Kelso?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Did Masten hire you to put me out of
business?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; whispered Kelso.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Masten stayin&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With Chavis&mdash;in the shack. He&#8217;s been
there right along, except,&#8221; he finished, with a
grim attempt at humor, &#8220;when he&#8217;s been rushin&#8217;
that biscuit-shooter in Lazette.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Five minutes later, standing near one of the
wheels of the chuck-wagon, gazing somberly at
the men, who were carrying Kelso away, Randerson
spoke grimly to Owen, who was standing
beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pickett an&#8217; then Kelso! Both of them was
sure bad enough. But I reckon Masten&#8217;s got
them both roped an&#8217; hog-tied for natural meanness.&#8221;
He turned to Owen. &#8220;I reckon I had
to do it, old man,&#8221; he said, a quaver in his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck up, Wrecks!&#8221; Owen slapped him on
the shoulder, and turned toward the men.
</p>
<p>Randerson watched him, but his thoughts were
elsewhere. &#8220;I reckon she&#8217;d have wanted it
different,&#8221; he said to himself.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>READY GUN AND CLEAN HEART</h3>
</div>

<p>Uncle Jepson understood the cow-punchers
because he understood human
nature, and because he had a strain of the wild
in him that had been retained since his youth.
Their simplicity, their directness, had been his
own; their frankness and generosity, their warm,
manly impulses&mdash;all reminded him of the days
before age, with its accompanying conservatism
of thought and action, had placed a governor
upon them. They understood him, too, recognizing
him as their kind. Blair, especially, had
taken a fancy to him, and therefore it was not
many days after the shooting of Kelso that Uncle
Jepson got the story, with all its gruesome details,
from his lips.
</p>
<p>The tale was related in strictest confidence,
and Uncle Jepson did not repeat it.
</p>
<p>But the main fact, that Randerson had killed
another man in his outfit, found its way to Ruth&#8217;s
ears through the medium of a roaming puncher
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
who had stopped for an hour at the ranchhouse.
Ruth had confirmed the news through questioning
several Flying W men, and, because of their
reluctance to answer her inquiries, their expressionless
faces, she gathered that the shooting had
not met with their approval. She did not consider
that they had given her no details, that they
spoke no word of blame or praise. She got
nothing but the bare fact&mdash;that Randerson&#8217;s gun
had again wrought havoc.
</p>
<p>She had not seen Masten. A month had slipped
by since the day of his departure, when she got
a note from him, by messenger, from Lazette,
saying that his business was not yet concluded,
and that possibly, two weeks more would elapse
before he would be able to visit the Flying W.
</p>
<p>Had Randerson, standing near the chuck
wagon on the night of the shooting of Kelso,
known what effect the news would have on Ruth?
&#8220;I reckon she would have wanted it different,&#8221; he
had reflected, then. And he had been entirely
correct, for the news had destroyed something
that had been growing and flourishing in her
heart. It had filled her soul with disappointment,
at least; repugnance and loathing were not very
far away. She had almost been persuaded, that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
day when he had taught her how to use the pistol.
The killing of Pickett had grown dim and distant
in her mental vision; Randerson had become a
compelling figure that dominated her thoughts.
But this second killing! She could no longer
interpret the steady, serene gleam in his eyes as
mild confidence and frank directness; as she saw
them now they reflected hypocrisy&mdash;the cold,
designing cunning of the habitual taker of human
life.
</p>
<p>She had been very near to making a mistake;
she had almost yielded to the lure of the romance
that had seemed to surround him; the magnetic
personality of him had attracted her. He
attracted her no longer&mdash;her heart was shut to
him. And, during the days of Masten&#8217;s continuing
absence&mdash;in the times when she reflected
on her feelings toward Randerson on the day he
had taught her the use of the pistol, she bitterly
reproached herself for her momentary lack of
loyalty to the Easterner. She had been weak for
an instant&mdash;as life is measured&mdash;and she would
make it up to Masten&mdash;by ceasing to be irritated
by his moods, through paying no attention to his
faults, which, she now saw, were infinitely less
grave than those of the man who had impressed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
her for an instant&mdash;and by yielding to his suggestion
that she marry him before the fall
round-up.
</p>
<p>In these days, too, she seriously thought of
discharging Randerson, for he had not ridden in
to report the killing and to offer a defense for it,
but she remembered Vickers&#8217; words: &#8220;Randerson
is square,&#8221; and she supposed that all cowboys
were alike, and would shoot&mdash;to kill&mdash;if they
considered their provocation to be great enough.
</p>
<p>But these thoughts did not occupy all of her
time. She found opportunities to ride and sew
and talk&mdash;the latter mostly with Aunt Martha
and Uncle Jepson. And she kept making her
visits to Hagar Catherson.
</p>
<p>Of late Ruth had noticed a change in the girl&#8217;s
manner. She seemed to have lost the vivacity
that had swept upon her with the coming of her
new clothes; she had grown quiet and thoughtful,
and had moods of intense abstraction. Ruth
rode to the cabin one morning, to find her sitting
on the edge of the porch, hugging Nig tightly
and whispering to him. Her eyes were moist
when Ruth rode up to the porch and looked down
at her, but they filled with delight when they
rested upon her visitor.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>She did not get up, though, and still held Nig,
despite the dog&#8217;s attempts to release himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been crying, Hagar?&#8221; Ruth inquired
as she dismounted and sat on the edge of
the porch close to the girl.
</p>
<p>Hagar smiled wanly and rubbed her eyes
vigorously with the back of her free hand,
meanwhile looking sidelong at Ruth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I reckon not,&#8221; she answered hesitatingly,
&#8220;that is, not cryin&#8217; regular. But I was
just tellin&#8217; Nig, here, that he&#8217;s the only sure
enough friend I&#8217;ve got&mdash;that can be depended
on not to fool anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Hagar!&#8221; Ruth was astonished and
perhaps a little hurt by this pessimistic view.
&#8220;What an odd idea for you to have! Who has
fooled you, Hagar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody,&#8221; said the girl almost sullenly. She
dug her bare toe into the deep sand at the edge
of the porch and looked down at the miniature
hill she was making, her lips set queerly. Ruth
had already noticed that she was dressed almost
as she had been at their first meeting&mdash;a slipover
apron that Ruth had given her being the
only new garment. It was the lonesomeness, of
course, Ruth reflected, and perhaps a vision of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
the dreary future, prospectless, hopeless, to be
filled with the monotony of the past. Her arm
stole out and was placed on Hagar&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t fooled you, Hagar,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;have I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; Her lips quivered. She
glanced furtively at Ruth, and a half frightened,
half dreading look came into her eyes. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s
fooled me,&#8221; she added with a nervous laugh. &#8220;I
was just feelin&#8217; sorta dumpish, I reckon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t brood, you know,&#8221; consoled
Ruth. &#8220;It ruins character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s character?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why,&#8221; hesitated Ruth, &#8220;the thing
that makes you yourself&mdash;apart from every
other person; your reputation; the good that is
in you&mdash;the good you feel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got any,&#8221; said the girl, morosely,
grimly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Hagar, you have! Everybody has&mdash;either
good or bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s bad, I reckon&mdash;if I&#8217;ve got any.&#8221; She
suddenly buried her face on Ruth&#8217;s shoulder and
sobbed.
</p>
<p>Perplexed, astonished, almost dismayed, Ruth
held her off and tried to look at her face. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
the girl only buried it deeper and continued to cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Hagar; whatever is the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no answer, and after holding her
for a time, Ruth succeeded in getting a look at
her face. It was tear-stained, but dogged in
expression, and had Ruth been experienced in
reading the human emotions, she could have seen
the guilt in the girl&#8217;s eyes, lurking far back. She
also might have seen the determination in them&mdash;a
determination not to tell her secret. And a
sorrow, also, was there&mdash;aroused through the
thought that she had deceived Ruth, and could
not tell her.
</p>
<p>Hagar realized now that she had permitted her
emotions to carry her too far, that she had
aroused Ruth&#8217;s curiosity. Ruth must never know!
She made an effort and sat up, laughing grimly
through her tears, shaking her hair back from
her eyes, brushing it away fiercely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad says there&#8217;s times when I&#8217;m half loco,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I reckon he&#8217;s right.&#8221; She recovered
her composure rapidly, and in a few minutes there
were no traces of tears or of mental distress.
But Ruth was puzzled, and after she left the
cabin she tried in vain to provide an explanation
for the girl&#8217;s strange conduct.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>On her next visit to the cabin, Ruth was
astonished when Hagar asked her bluntly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t there no punishment for men who
deceive girls?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very little, Hagar, I fear&mdash;unless it is God&#8217;s
punishment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; The girl&#8217;s eyes flashed vindictively.
&#8220;There ought to be. Durn &#8217;em,
anyway!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hagar, what has brought such a subject into
your mind?&#8221; said Ruth wonderingly.
</p>
<p>The girl reddened, but met Ruth&#8217;s eyes determinedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a book in here, that dad got
with some other traps from ol&#8217; man Cullen&#8217;s girls,
back in Red Rock&mdash;they thought we was poorly,
an&#8217; they helped us that-a-way. It&#8217;s &#8216;Millie&#8217;s
Lovers,&#8217; an&#8217; it tells how a man deceived a girl, an&#8217;
run away an&#8217; left her&mdash;the sneakin&#8217; coyote!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls shouldn&#8217;t read such books, Hagar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they ought to. But it ought to tell in &#8217;em
how to get even with the men who do things like
that!&#8221; She frowned as she looked at Ruth.
&#8220;What would you think of a man that done that
in real life?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think that he wouldn&#8217;t be much of
a man,&#8221; said Ruth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>As before, Ruth departed from this visit,
puzzled and wondering.
</p>
<p>On another morning, a few days following
Ruth&#8217;s discovery of the shooting of Kelso, she
found Hagar standing on the porch. The dog
had apprised Hagar of the coming of her visitor.
Hagar&#8217;s first words were:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear? Rex Randerson killed
Kelso.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard about it some days ago,&#8221; said Ruth.
&#8220;It&#8217;s horrible!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you reckon is horrible about it?&#8221;
questioned Hagar, with a queer look at her friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; returned Ruth, surprised; &#8220;the deed
itself! The very thought of one human being
taking the life of another!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s worse things than killin&#8217; a man that&#8217;s
tryin&#8217; to make you shuffle off,&#8221; declared Hagar
evenly. &#8220;Rex Randerson wouldn&#8217;t kill nobody
unless they made him do it. An&#8217; accordin&#8217; to
what dad says, Kelso pulled first. Rex ain&#8217;t lettin&#8217;
nobody perforate <i>him</i>, you bet!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is too ready with his pistol.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl caught the repugnance in Ruth&#8217;s voice.
&#8220;I thought you kind of liked Randerson,&#8221; she
said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>Ruth blushed. &#8220;What made you think that?&#8221;
she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that you&#8217;ve gone ridin&#8217; with him
a lot. I just reckoned it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, Hagar. I do not like
Randerson at all. He is my range boss&mdash;that is
all. A murderer could never be a friend to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A shadow came over Hagar&#8217;s face. &#8220;Rex
Randerson has got a clean heart,&#8221; she said
slowly. She stood looking at Ruth, disappointment
plain in her eyes. The disappointment was
quickly succeeded by suspicion; she caught her
breath, and the hands that were under her apron
gripped each other hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ll take up with Masten again,&#8221;
she said, trying to control her voice.
</p>
<p>Ruth looked intently at her, but she did not
notice the girl&#8217;s emotion through her interest in
her words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;again&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that you&#8217;d broke your engagement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; Ruth&#8217;s voice was
sharp, for she thought Randerson perhaps had
been talking.
</p>
<p>Hagar blushed crimson and resorted to a lie.
&#8220;My dad told me. He said he&#8217;d heard it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it isn&#8217;t true,&#8221; Ruth told her firmly; &#8220;I
have never broken with Mr. Masten. And we
are to be married soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned, for she was slightly indignant at
this evidence that the people in the country near
her had been meddling with her affairs, and she
did not see the ashen pallor that quickly spread
over Hagar&#8217;s face. Had Ruth been looking she
must have suspected the girl&#8217;s secret. But it
took her some time to mount her pony, and then
looking back she waved her hand at Hagar, who
was smiling, though with pale and drawn face.
</p>
<p>Hagar stood rigid on the porch until she could
no longer see Ruth. Then she sank to the edge
of the porch, gathered the dog Nig into her arms,
and buried her face in his unkempt shoulder.
Rocking back and forth in a paroxysm of impotent
passion, she spoke to the dog:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t kill him now, Nig, he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to marry
<i>her</i>! Oh Nig, Nig, what am I goin&#8217; to do now?&#8221;
And then she looked up scornfully, her eyes
flashing. &#8220;She won&#8217;t let Rex be a friend of hers,
because he&#8217;s killed two men that God had ought
to have killed a long while ago! But she&#8217;ll marry
Masten&mdash;who ain&#8217;t fit to be Rex&#8217;s dog. She
won&#8217;t, Nig! Why&mdash;?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>She got up and started for the door. But nearing
it, she sank upon the threshold, crying and
moaning, while Nig, perplexed at this conduct
on the part of his mistress, stood off a little and
barked loudly at her.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE BUBBLE&mdash;DREAMS</h3>
</div>

<p>Loping his pony through the golden haze of
the afternoon, Randerson came over the
plains toward the Flying W ranchhouse, tingling
with anticipation. The still small voice to which
he had listened in the days before Ruth&#8217;s coming
had not lied to him; Fate, or whatever power
ruled the destinies of lovers, had made her for
him. Man&#8217;s interference might delay the time
of possession, his thoughts were of Masten for a
brief instant, and his lips straightened, but in the
end there could be no other outcome.
</p>
<p>But though he was as certain of her as he was
that the sun would continue to rule the days, he
kept his confidence from betraying his thoughts,
and when at last he rode slowly down along the
corral fence, past the bunkhouse and the other
buildings, to the edge of the porch, sitting quietly
in the saddle and looking down at Ruth, who was
sitting in a rocker, sewing, his face was grave and
his manner that of unconscious reverence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>Ruth had been on the porch for more than an
hour. And as on the day when he had come riding
in in obedience to her orders to teach her the
mysteries of the six-shooter, she watched him
today&mdash;with anticipation, but with anticipation
of a different sort, in which was mingled a little
regret, but burdened largely with an eagerness
to show him, unmistakably, that he was not the
sort of man that she could look upon seriously.
And so when she saw him ride up to the porch and
bring his pony to a halt, she laid her sewing in her
lap, folded her hands over it, and watched him
with outward calmness, though with a vague
sorrow gripping her. For in spite of what he
had done, she still felt the man&#8217;s strong personality,
his virility&mdash;the compelling lure of him.
She experienced a quick, involuntary tightening of
the muscles when she heard his voice&mdash;for it
intensified the regret in her&mdash;low, drawling,
gentle:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come in to report to you, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said calmly. She leaned back
in her chair, looking at him, feeling a quick pulse
of pity for him, for as she sat there and waited,
saying nothing further, she saw a faint red steal
into his cheeks. She knew that he had expected
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
an invitation to join her on the porch; he was
entitled to that courtesy because of her treatment
of him on the occasion of his previous visit; and
that when the invitation did not come he could
not but feel deeply the embarrassment of the situation.
</p>
<p>The faint glow died out of his face, and the
lines of his lips grew a trifle more firm. This
reception was not the one he had anticipated, but
then there were moods into which people fell.
She was subject to moods, too, for he remembered
the night she had hurt her ankle&mdash;how she had
&#8220;roasted&#8221; him. And his face grew long with
an inward mirth. She would ask him to get off
his horse, presently, and then he was going to
tell her of his feelings on that night.
</p>
<p>But she did not invite him to alight. On the
contrary, she maintained a silence that was nearly
severe. He divined that this mood was to continue
and instead of getting off his pony he swung
crossways in the saddle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the cattle all out of the hills an&#8217;
the timber, an&#8217; we&#8217;re workin&#8217; down the crick
toward here,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
unusual happened, except&#8221;&mdash;and here he paused
for a brief instant&mdash;&#8220;that I had to shoot a man.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
It was Watt Kelso, from over Lazette way. I
hired him two weeks before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard of it,&#8221; she returned steadily, her
voice expressionless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hated like poison to do it. But I had no
choice. He brought it on himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so,&#8221; she said flatly. She looked
at him now with the first flash of emotion that
she had allowed him to see. &#8220;If killing people
is your trade, and you choose to persist in it, I
don&#8217;t see how we are to stop you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked sharply at her, but his voice was low
and even. &#8220;I don&#8217;t shoot folks for the fun of it,
ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;&mdash;with scornful disbelief. &#8220;Well,
I presume it doesn&#8217;t make much difference. Dead
people wouldn&#8217;t appreciate the joke, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His face was serious now, for he could see that
she was deeply disturbed over the shooting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you wouldn&#8217;t believe me, no matter
how hard I talked,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;d have your
own opinion. It sure does look bad for me&mdash;havin&#8217;
to plug two guys in one season. An&#8217; I
don&#8217;t blame you for feelin&#8217; like you do about it.
But I&#8217;ve got this to say,&#8221; he went on earnestly.
&#8220;Kelso come to the outfit, lookin&#8217; for trouble.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
I&#8217;d had a run-in with him a few years ago. An&#8217; I
shot him&mdash;in the arm. I thought it was all over.
But along comes Kelso, with his mustache shaved
off so&#8217;s I wouldn&#8217;t know him&mdash;which I did. He
asked me for a job, an&#8217; I give it to him&mdash;hopin&#8217;.
But hopes&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you knew him, why did you give him a
job?&#8221; she interrupted. &#8220;It might have saved
you shooting him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was wantin&#8217; to force trouble he&#8217;d have
done it sooner or later, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, interested in spite of
herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He waited two weeks for a chance. I didn&#8217;t
give him any chance. An&#8217; then, one night, after
Red Owen had been cuttin&#8217; up some monkey
shines, he talked fresh an&#8217; pulled his gun. He
was a regular gunfighter, ma&#8217;am; he&#8217;d been hired
to put me out of business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an appeal in his eyes that did not
show in his voice; and it would be all the appeal
that he would make. Looking fixedly at him, she
became certain of that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who hired him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was that in her tone which told him that
he might now make his case strong&mdash;might even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
convince her, and thus be restored to that grace
from which he, plainly, had fallen. But he was
a claimant for her hand, he had told her that he
would not press that claim until she broke her
engagement with Masten, and if he now told her
that it had been the Easterner who had hired
Kelso to kill him, he would have felt that she
would think he had taken advantage of the situation,
selfishly. And he preferred to take his
chance, slender though it seemed to be.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t tell me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you only suspected it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent for an instant. Then: &#8220;A man
told me he was hired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t mentionin&#8217;, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He could not
tell her that Blair had told him, after he had told
Blair not to mention it.
</p>
<p>She smiled with cold incredulity, and he knew
his chance had gone.
</p>
<p>But he was not prepared for her next words.
In her horror for his deed, she had ceased to
respect him; she had ceased to believe him; his
earnest protestations of innocence of wantonness
she thought were hypocritical&mdash;an impression
strengthened by his statement that Kelso had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
hired to kill him, and by his inability to show evidence
to prove it. A shiver of repulsion, for him
and his killings, ran over her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are lying, Randerson,&#8221; she said,
coldly.
</p>
<p>He started, stiffened, and then stared, at her,
his face slowly whitening. She had said words
that, spoken by a man, would have brought about
another of those killings that horrified her. She
watched him, sensing for the first time something
of the terrible emotions that sometimes beset men
in tense situations but entirely unconscious of the
fact that she had hurt him far more than any
bullet could have hurt him.
</p>
<p>Yet, aside from the whiteness of his face, he
took the fatal thrust without a sign. His dreams,
that had seemed to be so real to him while riding
over the plains toward the ranchhouse, had been
bubbles that she had burst with a breath. He saw
the wrecks of them go sailing into the dust at his
feet.
</p>
<p>He had gazed downward, and he did not look
up at once. When he did, his gaze rested, as
though by prearrangement, on her. Her eyes
were still cold, still disbelieving, and he drew
himself slowly erect.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ve said enough, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he
told her quietly, though his voice was a trifle
hoarse. &#8220;A man couldn&#8217;t help but understand
that.&#8221; He wheeled Patches and took off his hat
to her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send Red Owen to see you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;I can recommend Red.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was on her feet, ready to turn to go into
the house, for his manner of receiving her insult
had made her feel infinitely small and mean. But
at his words she halted and looked at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you send Red Owen to see me?
What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;ve made it pretty plain, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he
answered with a low laugh, turning his head to
look back at her. &#8220;I reckon you wouldn&#8217;t expect
me to go on workin&#8217; for you, after you&#8217;ve got so
you don&#8217;t trust me any more. Red will make you
a good range boss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He urged Patches on. But she called to him, a
strange regret filling her, whitening her cheeks,
and Patches came again to a halt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t want Red Owen for a range boss,&#8221;
she declared with a gulp. &#8220;If you are determined
to quit, I&mdash;I suppose I cannot prevent it. But
you can stay a week or two, can&#8217;t you&mdash;until I
can get somebody I like?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>He smiled gravely. &#8220;Why, I reckon I can,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he answered respectfully. &#8220;There won&#8217;t
be no awful hurry about it. I wouldn&#8217;t want to
disconvenience you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then he was off into the deepening haze of
the coming evening, riding tall and rigid, with
never a look behind to show her that he cared.
</p>
<p>Standing in the doorway of the house, the girl
watched him, both hands at her breast, her eyes
wide, her lips parted, her cheeks flushed, until the
somber shadows of twilight came down and
swallowed him. Then, oppressed with a sudden
sense of the emptiness of the world, she went into
the house.

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>ONE TOO MANY</h3>
</div>

<p>To no man in the outfit did Randerson whisper
a word concerning the result of his
visit to the ranchhouse&mdash;that he would cease to
be the Flying W range boss just as soon as Ruth
Harkness could find a man to replace him. He
went his way, thoughtful, silent, grave, filled with
somber thoughts and dark passions that sometimes
flashed in his eyes, but taking no man into his confidence.
And yet they knew that all was not well
with him. For in other days his dry humor, his
love of wholesome fun, had shortened many an
hour for them, and his serenity, in ordinary difficulties,
had become a byword to them. And
so they knew that the thing which was troubling
him now was not ordinary.
</p>
<p>They thought they knew what was troubling
him. Kelso had been hired to take his life. Kelso
had lost his own in the effort. That might have
seemed to end it. But it had become known that
Kelso had been a mere tool in the hands of an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
unscrupulous plotter, and until the plotter had
been sent on the way that Kelso had gone there
could be no end. Already there were whispers
over the country because of Randerson&#8217;s delay.
</p>
<p>Of course, they would wait a reasonable time;
they would give him his &#8220;chance.&#8221; But they did
not know what was holding him back&mdash;that deep
in his heart lurked a hope that one day he might
still make his dreams come true, and that if he
killed Masten, Ruth&#8217;s abhorrence of him and his
deeds, already strong, could never be driven from
her. If he lost this hope, Masten was doomed.
</p>
<p>And during the second week following his latest
talk with Ruth, the girl unconsciously killed it. He
met her in the open, miles from the ranchhouse,
and he rode toward her, deeply repentant, resolved
to brave public scorn by allowing Masten to
live.
</p>
<p>He smiled gravely at her when he came close&mdash;she
waiting for him, looking at him, unmoved.
For she had determined to show him that she had
meant what she had said to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you found a new range boss, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;
he said gently. He had hoped that she might
answer lightly, and then he would have known that
she would forgive him, in time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>But her chin went up and she looked coldly at
him. &#8220;You will be able to leave the Flying W
shortly, Randerson,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am going to
leave such matters for Mr. Masten to look after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She urged her pony away and left him, staring
somberly after her.
</p>
<p>Two hours later he was riding down the declivity
toward Chavis&#8217; shack, in the basin. He had
ridden first to the outfit, and had talked with
Owen. And his appearance had been such that
when he left the foreman the latter sought out
Blair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t miss my reckonin&#8217;, Masten&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to get his&#8217;n today.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Randerson rode, straight as Patches could carry
him, to the door of Chavis&#8217; shack. No one
appeared to greet him, but he had seen horses,
saddled, hitched to the corral fence, and he knew
that some one was about. Chavis, Kester, and
Hilton were inside the shack, and when they heard
him ride up, they came to the door, curious. And
when they saw him they stiffened and stood rigid,
with not a finger moving, for they had seen men,
before, meditating violence, and they saw the
signs in Randerson&#8217;s chilled and narrowed eyes,
and in the grim set of his lips.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>His lips moved; his teeth hardly parted to
allow the words to come through them. They
writhed through:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Masten?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Three pairs of lungs sighed audibly in process
of deflation.
</p>
<p>It was Chavis who answered; the other two
looked at him when the question came, silently.
Chavis would have lied, but the light in Randerson&#8217;s
eyes warned him not to trifle, and the truth
came from his lips:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Masten&#8217;s gone to the Flyin&#8217; W ranchhouse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said Randerson shortly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m thankin&#8217; you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He rode away, grinning coldly back at them,
still watchful, for he knew Chavis, guiding his
pony toward the declivity on the other side of the
basin. The three men watched him until the pony
had climbed to the mesa. Then Chavis turned to
the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to see Masten about that
Kelso deal,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Somebody ought to put
Masten wise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kester grinned. &#8220;It&#8217;s bound to come,&#8221; he
commented. &#8220;Let&#8217;s finish our game; it is your
deal.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>On the mesa, Randerson urged Patches along
the edge, over the trail that Ruth had taken when,
months before, she had come upon Chavis and
Kester at the declivity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; would have happened, if it hadn&#8217;t
been for Masten,&#8221; he told himself as he rode
away. &#8220;Pickett wouldn&#8217;t have got fresh, an&#8217;
Kelso would have kept himself mighty shady.
We&#8217;d have fought it out, square&mdash;me an&#8217;
Masten. I reckon I didn&#8217;t kill Pickett and Kelso;
it was Masten that done it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He came, after a while, to the rock upon whick
he had found Ruth lying on the night of the accident.
And he sat and looked long at the
grass plot where he had laid her when she had
fainted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She looked like an angel, layin&#8217; there,&#8221; he
reminded himself, his eyes eloquent. &#8220;She&#8217;s too
blamed good for that sneakin&#8217; dude.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He came upon the ruined boot, and memories
grimmed his lips. &#8220;It&#8217;s busted&mdash;like my
dreams,&#8221; he said, surveying it, ripped and rotting.
&#8220;I reckon this is as good a place as any,&#8221; he
added, looking around him.
</p>
<p>And he dismounted, led Patches out of sight
behind some high bushes that grew far back from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
the rocks; came back, stretched himself out on
the grass plot, pulled his hat over his eyes and
yielded to his gloomy thoughts. But after he
had lain there a while, he spoke aloud:
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come this way, if he comes at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With the memory of Randerson&#8217;s threat always
before him, &#8220;if I ever lay eyes on you ag&#8217;in, I&#8217;ll
go gunnin&#8217; for you,&#8221; Masten rode slowly and
watchfully. For he had felt that the words had
not been idle ones, and it had been because of
them that he had hired Kelso. And he went
toward the ranchhouse warily, much relieved
when he passed the bunkhouse, to find that Randerson
was apparently absent. He intended to
make this one trip, present to Ruth his excuses for
staying away, and then go back to Chavis&#8217; shack,
there to remain out of Randerson&#8217;s sight, until
he could devise another plan that, he hoped,
would put an end to the cowpuncher who was
forever tormenting him.
</p>
<p>His excuses had been accepted by Ruth, for
she was in the mood to restore him to that spot
in her heart that Randerson had come very near
to occupy. She listened to him calmly, and
agreed, without conscious emotion, to his proposal
that they ride, on the Monday following, to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
Lazette, to marry. She had reopened the subject
a little wearily, for now that Randerson was hopeless
she wanted to have the marriage over with
as soon as possible. She saw now, that it had
been the vision of Randerson, always prominent
in her mind, that had caused her to put off the
date of her marriage to Masten when he had
mentioned it before. That vision had vanished
now, and she did not care how soon she became
Masten&#8217;s wife.
</p>
<p>On the porch of the ranchhouse they had
reached the agreement, and triumphantly Masten
rode away into the darkness, foreseeing the defeat
of the man whom he had feared as a possible
rival, seeing, too&mdash;if he could not remove him
entirely&mdash;his dismissal from the Flying W and
his own ascent to power.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On Monday, then,&#8221; he said softly to Ruth,
as ready to leave, he had looked down at her
from his horse. &#8220;I shall come early, remember,
for I have waited long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Monday,&#8221; she had answered. And then,
dully: &#8220;I have waited, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten was thinking of this exchange of
words as he rode past the ford where the Lazette
trail crossed into the broken country beyond it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
He had not liked the tone of her voice when she
had answered him; she had not seemed
enthusiastic enough to suit him. But he did not
feel very greatly disturbed over her manner, for
Monday would end it, and then he would do as
he pleased.
</p>
<p>He was passing a huge boulder, when from out
of the shadow surrounding it a somber figure
stepped, the star-shot sky shedding sufficient light
for Masten to distinguish its face. He recognized
Randerson, and he voluntarily brought
his pony to a halt and stiffened in the saddle,
fear, cold and paralyzing, gripping him. He did
not speak; he made no sound beyond a quick gasp
as his surprised lungs sought air, and he was incapable
of action.
</p>
<p>Randerson, though, did not make a hostile
movement and did not present a foreboding figure.
His arms were folded over his chest, and if it had
not been for Masten&#8217;s recollection of those grim
words, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go gunnin&#8217; for you,&#8221; Masten would
have felt reasonably secure. But he remembered
the words, and his voice caught in his throat and
would not come, when he essayed to bluster and
ask Randerson the cause for this strange and
dramatic appearance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>But there was no thought of the dramatic in
Randerson&#8217;s mind as he stood there&mdash;nothing
but cold hatred and determination&mdash;nothing
except a bitter wish that the man on the pony
would reach for his gun and thus make his task
easier for him.
</p>
<p>The hoped-for movement did not come, and
Randerson spoke shortly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get off your cayuse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten obeyed silently, his knees shaking under
him. Was it to be another fist fight? Randerson&#8217;s
voice broke in on this thought:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised to kill you. You&#8217;re a thing that
sneaks around at night on its belly, an&#8217; you ought
to be killed. But I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to give you a chance&mdash;like
you give me when you set Kelso on me.
That&#8217;ll let you die like a man&mdash;which you
ain&#8217;t!&#8221; He tapped the gun at his right hip. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
use this one. We&#8217;ll stand close&mdash;where we are&mdash;to
make your chance better. When I count
three you draw your gun. Show your man now,
if there&#8217;s any in you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He dropped his hands from his chest and held
the right, the fingers bent like the talons of a bird
of prey, about to seize a victim. He waited, his
eyes gleaming in the starlight, with cold alertness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
for Masten&#8217;s expected move toward his gun. But
after a long, breathless silence, during which
Masten&#8217;s knees threatened to give way, he leaned
forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Flash it! Quick! Or you go out anyway!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m unarmed!&#8221; Masten&#8217;s voice would not
come before. It burst forth now, hysterically,
gaspingly, sounding more like a moan than the
cry of a man pleading for his life.
</p>
<p>But it stung the stern-faced man before him to
action, rapid and tense. He sprang forward with
a low, savage exclamation, drawing one of his
big weapons and jamming its muzzle deep into
Masten&#8217;s stomach. Then, holding it there, that
the Easterner might not trick him, he ran his
other hand over the frightened man&#8217;s clothing,
and found no weapon. Then he stepped back
with a laugh, low, scornful, and bitter. The
discovery that Masten was not armed seemed to
drive his cold rage from him, and when he spoke
again his voice was steely and contemptuous:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can hit the breeze, I reckon&mdash;I ain&#8217;t
murderin&#8217; anybody. You&#8217;re safe right now. But
I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you this: I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; for you, an&#8217; you
don&#8217;t run no blazer in on me no more! After
this, you go heeled&mdash;or you hit the breeze out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
of the country. One of us has got to go. This
country is too crowded with both of us!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten got on his pony, trembling so that he
had trouble in getting his feet into the stirrups.
He rode on, hundreds of yards, before he dared
to turn, so great was his dread that to do so would
be to bring upon him the wrath of the man who
had spared him. But finally he looked around.
He saw Randerson riding out into the darkness
of the vast stretch of grass-land that lay to the
south.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>INTO WHICH A GIRL&#8217;S TROUBLE COMES</h3>
</div>

<p>Uncle Jepson and Aunt Martha had not
seen Masten when he had visited Ruth, for
they had gone in the buckboard to Red Rock.
And Masten had departed when they reached
home. Nor did they see Ruth after they arrived,
for she had gone to bed. But at the breakfast
table Ruth told them of the visit of Masten and
of her plan to advance the date of the marriage.
</p>
<p>Uncle Jepson and Aunt Martha received the
news in silence. Aunt Martha did manage to
proffer a half-hearted congratulation, but Uncle
Jepson wrinkled his nose, as he did always when
displeased, and said nothing; and he ate lightly.
Ruth did not notice that she had spoiled his
appetite, nor did she note with more than casual
interest that he left the table long before she or
Aunt Martha. She did not see him, standing at
the corral fence, scowling, and she could not hear
the old-fashioned profanity that gushed from his
lips.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you glad?&#8221; Ruth asked Aunt Martha
when they were alone, for she had noted her
relative&#8217;s lack of enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, honey,&#8221; Aunt Martha smiled at
her, though it seemed forced. &#8220;Only&mdash;&#8221; She
hesitated eloquently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only what, Aunt Martha?&#8221; Ruth&#8217;s voice was
a little sharp, as with all persons who act in
opposition to her better judgment and who resent
anyone understanding them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only I was hoping it would be Randerson,
my dear,&#8221; said Aunt Martha gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Randerson!&#8221; Ruth&#8217;s voice was scornful. But
it sounded insincere to her, and she would trust
it no further.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Honey!&#8221; Aunt Martha&#8217;s arm was around
her, and Aunt Martha&#8217;s sympathetic and knowing
eyes were compelling hers; and her voice was
ineffably gentle. &#8220;Are you sure, honey, that you
don&#8217;t wish it were Randerson? It is a great event
in your life, dear, and once it is done, it can&#8217;t be
undone. Don&#8217;t be hasty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can never be Randerson,&#8221; Ruth said firmly&mdash;not,
however, as firmly as she had intended.
&#8220;Randerson is a murderer&mdash;a reckless taker of
human life!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>had</i> to shoot, they say,&#8221; defended Aunt
Martha. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he would harm a living
thing except in defense of his own life. Defending
themselves is their way out here, girl&mdash;they
know no other way. And he is a man, dear. I
don&#8217;t know when I have met a man who has
impressed me more!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t talk about it any more.&#8221; Ruth&#8217;s
face was pale, her brows contracted, for Aunt
Martha&#8217;s reference to Randerson had brought
back haunting sensations that, she thought, she
had succeeded in putting out of her life. She was
ready to cry, and when she thought of Randerson&mdash;how
calmly he had accepted his dismissal,
with what manliness he had borne her insults, a
chill of sympathy ran over her. She believed she
would never forget him as he had looked on the
night he had ridden away after telling her that
he would leave the Flying W&mdash;riding into the
darkness of the plains, with his hopes blasted,
bravely making no complaint.
</p>
<p>She got her pony, after a while, and rode far
and long, coming in to the ranchhouse about noon.
After she had turned the pony into the corral and
was coming toward the house, she saw Uncle
Jepson sitting on the porch, puffing furiously at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
his pipe. She spoke to him in greeting, and was
about to pass him to go into the house, when he
called to her:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk to you a minute, Ruth.&#8221; He
spoke rapidly, his voice dry and light, and she
could see his facial muscles twitching. Wonderingly,
she sank into a chair near him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure thinkin&#8217; of marryin&#8217; Masten,
girl?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she declared firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then I&#8217;ve got to tell you,&#8221; said Uncle
Jepson decisively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been puttin&#8217; it off, hopin&#8217;
that you&#8217;d get shet of that imp of Satan, an&#8217; I
wouldn&#8217;t have to say anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jep!&#8221; she protested indignantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what he is, Ruth&mdash;a durned imp
of the devil. I&#8217;ve knowed it from the first day I
saw him. Since he&#8217;s come out here, he&#8217;s proved
it.&#8221; He swung his chair around and faced her,
and forgetting his pipe in his excitement, he told
her the story he had told Randerson: how he had
gone into the messhouse on the day of the killing
of Pickett, for a rest and a smoke, and how, while
in there he had overheard Chavis and Pickett
plotting against Randerson, planning Pickett&#8217;s
attack on her, mentioning Masten&#8217;s connection
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
with the scheme. She did not open her lips until
Uncle Jepson had concluded, and then she
murmured a low &#8220;Oh!&#8221; and sat rigid, gripping
the arms of her chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; that ain&#8217;t all, it ain&#8217;t half of it!&#8221; pursued
Uncle Jepson vindictively. &#8220;Do you know that
Masten set that Watt Kelso, the gunfighter, on
Randerson?&#8221; He looked at Ruth, saw her start
and draw a long breath, and he grinned triumphantly.
&#8220;Course you don&#8217;t know; I cal&#8217;late
Randerson would never make a peep about it.
He&#8217;s all man&mdash;that feller. But it&#8217;s a fact. Blair
told me. There&#8217;d been bad blood between Randerson
an&#8217; Kelso, an&#8217; Masten took advantage of
it. He paid Kelso five hundred dollars in cold
cash to kill Randerson!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it can&#8217;t be!&#8221; moaned the girl, covering
her face with her hands and shrinking into her
chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; said Uncle Jepson derisively, but
more gently now, for he saw that the girl was
badly hurt. &#8220;The whole country is talkin&#8217; about
it, Ruth, an&#8217; wonderin&#8217; why Randerson don&#8217;t
salivate that durned dude! An&#8217; the country
expects him to do it, girl! They&#8217;ll fun him out of
here, if he don&#8217;t! Why, girl,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
don&#8217;t know how much of a sneak a man can be
when he&#8217;s got it in him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was shuddering as though he had struck
her, and he was on the edge of his chair, looking
at her pityingly, when Aunt Martha came to the
door and saw them. She was out on the porch
instantly, flushing with indignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jep Coakley, you&#8217;re up to your tricks again,
ain&#8217;t you? You quit devilin&#8217; that girl, now, an&#8217;
go on about your business!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some things to say, an&#8217; I cal&#8217;late to
say them!&#8221; declared Uncle Jepson determinedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve kept still about it long enough. I ain&#8217;t
wantin&#8217; to hurt her,&#8221; he added apologetically, as
Aunt Martha slipped to her knees beside Ruth
and put an arm around her, &#8220;but that durned
Masten has been doin&#8217; some things that she&#8217;s got
to know about, right now. An&#8217; then, if she&#8217;s
set on marryin&#8217; him, why, I cal&#8217;late it&#8217;s her
business. It was Masten who was behind Pickett
kissin&#8217; her&mdash;he tellin&#8217; Pickett to do it. An&#8217; he
hired Kelso to kill Randerson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ruth!&#8221; said Aunt Martha, her voice
shaky, as she nestled her head close to the girl&#8217;s.
But her eyes shone with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another thing,&#8221; went on Uncle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
Jepson to Ruth. &#8220;Did you notice Randerson&#8217;s
face, the night he come to hunt you, when you
hurt your ankle? Marked up, kind of, it was,
wasn&#8217;t it? An&#8217; do you know what Masten went
to Las Vegas for? Business, shucks! He went
there to get his face nursed up, Ruth&mdash;because
Randerson had smashed it for him! They&#8217;d had
a fight; I saw them, both comin&#8217; from the same
direction, that night. I reckon Randerson had
pretty nigh killed him. What for?&#8221; he asked as
Ruth turned wide, questioning eyes on him.
&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t rightly know. But I&#8217;ve got suspicions.
I&#8217;ve seen Masten goin&#8217; day after day
through that break in the canyon over there. A
hundred times, I cal&#8217;late. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve seen him here,
when you wasn&#8217;t lookin&#8217;, kissin&#8217; that Catherson
girl. I cal&#8217;late, if you was to ask her, she&#8217;d be
able to tell you a heap more about Masten,
Ruth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ruth got up, pale and terribly calm, disengaging
herself from Aunt Martha and standing
before Uncle Jepson. He too got to his feet.
</p>
<p>Ruth&#8217;s voice quavered. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t, oh,
you couldn&#8217;t lie to me, Uncle, because you like
Rex Randerson? Is it true?&#8221; She put her
hands on his shoulders and shook him, excitedly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;True? Why, Ruth, girl; it&#8217;s as true as there&#8217;s
a Supreme Bein&#8217; above us. Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>But she waited to hear no more, turning from
him and putting out her hands to keep Aunt
Martha away as she passed her. She went out to
the corral, got her pony, saddled it, mounted, and
rode over the plains toward the break in the
canyon wall. Uncle Jepson had one quick glimpse
of her eyes as she turned from him, and he knew
there would be no Monday for Willard Masten.
</p>
<p>Ruth had no feelings as she rode. The news
had stunned her. She had only one thought&mdash;to
see Hagar Catherson, to confirm or disprove
Uncle Jepson&#8217;s story. She could not have told
whether the sun was shining, or whether it was
afternoon or morning. But she must see Hagar
Catherson at once, no matter what the time or
the difficulties. She came to the break in the
canyon after an age, and rode through it, down
across the bed of the river, over the narrow
bridle path that led to the Catherson cabin.
</p>
<p>The dog Nig did not greet her this time; he
was stretched out on his belly, his hind legs
gathered under him, his forelegs stuck out in
front, his long muzzle extending along them, while
he watched in apparent anxiety the face of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
master, Abe Catherson, who was sitting on the
edge of the porch, his elbows on his knees, his
chin in his hands, in an attitude of deep dejection.
The dog&#8217;s concern was for Catherson&#8217;s future
actions, for just a few minutes before he had
witnessed a scene that had made his hair bristle,
had brought ugly growls out of him, had plunged
him into such a state of fury that he had, for one
wild instant, meditated a leap at his master&#8217;s
throat. He had seen his master leap upon his
mistress and raise his hand to strike her. If the
blow had been struck&mdash;Nig would have leaped,
then, no matter what the consequences.
</p>
<p>Catherson had not struck. But one great,
dominating passion was in his mind at this
moment&mdash;the yearning to slay! The dog had
seen him, twice during the last half hour, draw out
his heavy six-shooter and examine it, and each
time the dog had growled his disapproval of the
action. And on both occasions Catherson had
muttered thickly: &#8220;I wish I knowed, for sure.
A man can&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; if he don&#8217;t know. But I
reckon it was him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked up to see Ruth coming toward him.
The girl had seen him twice&mdash;had spoken to
him. He was a bearded giant, grizzled, unkempt,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
with hairy arms, massive and muscled superbly,
and great hands, burned brown by the sun, that
were just now clenched, forming two big fists.
There had been a humorous, tolerant twinkle in
his eyes on the other occasions that Ruth had
seen him; it was as though he secretly
sympathized with her efforts to do something for
his girl, though he would not openly approve. But
now she saw that his eyes were blazing with an
insane frenzy, that his lips were working, and
that the muscles of his neck stood out like great
cords, strained to the bursting point.
</p>
<p>He got up when he saw Ruth, and stood on
the sand at the edge of the porch, swaying back
and forth, and Ruth&#8217;s first thought was that he
had been drinking. But his first words to her
revealed her mistake. It was the light, dry voice
of a violent passion that greeted her, a passion
that was almost too great for words. He ran
to her pony and seized it by the bridle:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, ma&#8217;am. Tell me who treated my
li&#8217;l gal like that?&#8221; His great hands writhed in
the reins. &#8220;I&#8217;ll twist his buzzard&#8217;s head off his
shoulders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Ruth&#8217;s own voice
startled her, for the spirit of a lie had issued from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
her mouth; she knew what he meant; she realized
that Uncle Jepson had told the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; There was wild
derision in his voice, insane mirth. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
been comin&#8217; here; she&#8217;s been goin&#8217; to your place!
An&#8217; you don&#8217;t know! You&#8217;re blinder than me&mdash;an&#8217;
I couldn&#8217;t see at all!&#8221; He went off into a
gale of frenzied laughter, at which the dog began
to bark. Then Catherson&#8217;s eyes glared cunningly.
&#8220;But you&#8217;ve seen who&#8217;s been comin&#8217;
here; you know the man&#8217;s name, ma&#8217;am; an&#8217;
you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to tell me, ain&#8217;t you? So&#8217;s I c&#8217;n talk
to him&mdash;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Mr. Catherson.&#8221; Ruth got
a firm grip on herself before she answered, and
it was to save a life that she lied again, for she
saw murder in Catherson&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Where is
Hagar?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>At his jerk of the head toward the cabin door
Ruth got down from her pony. She was trembling
all over, but at Catherson&#8217;s words all thought
of self had been banished. The effect of
Masten&#8217;s deed on her own life, his duplicity, his
crimes&mdash;all were forgotten. Here was her
friend who had been sinned against, needing the
comfort of her presence. And in an instant she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
was inside the cabin, leaning over the little figure
that was curled up in a bunk in a corner, speaking
low words of cheer and forgiveness.
</p>
<p>Outside, Catherson paced back and forth, his
lips forming soundless words, his big hands
working as though the fingers were at the throat
of the thief that had stolen into his home. His
mind was going over certain words that Hagar
had answered to his questions, just before Ruth&#8217;s
coming. He dwelt upon every slight circumstance
that had occurred during the past few months.
There were the tracks of horse&#8217;s hoofs about the
cabin, in the paths and trails leading to it. Hagar
had refused to tell him. But he figured it all out
for himself, as he walked. When had this thing
started? At about the time that Randerson had
taken Vickers&#8217; place at the Flying W! Why had
not there been trouble between him and the Flying
W, as under previous range bosses? What had
Randerson given him money for, many times?
Ah, he knew now!
</p>
<p>&#8220;The black-hearted hound!&#8221; he gritted.
</p>
<p>He reeled, and held to a corner of the cabin
to steady himself, for this last access of rage
came near to paralyzing him. When he recovered
he drew back out of sight, and leaning against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
the wall of the cabin, with a pencil and a small
piece of paper taken from a note book in a pocket,
he wrote. He laid the piece of paper on the
edge of the porch, ran to the corral and caught
his pony, mounted, and rode drunkenly down the
narrow path toward the break in the canyon.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>BANISHING A SHADOW</h3>
</div>

<p>Randerson could not adjust his principles
to his purpose to do Masten to death while
working for Ruth, and so, in the morning following
his meeting with the Easterner on the trail
leading to Chavis&#8217; shack, he announced to the
men of the outfit that he was going to quit. He
told Red Owen to take charge until Ruth could
see him.
</p>
<p>Glum looks followed his announcement. They
tried to dissuade him, for they did not know his
thoughts, and perhaps would not have given him
credit for them if they had.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t the outfit suit you?&#8221; asked one gently.
&#8220;If it don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll try to do better!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your conduct has been amazin&#8217; good&mdash;considerin&#8217;,&#8221;
grinned Randerson, light-hearted for
the time; for this mark of affection was not lost
upon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s anybody in the outfit that&#8217;s disagreeable
to you, why, say the word an&#8217; we&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
make him look mighty scarce!&#8221; declared another,
glancing belligerently around him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks, this outfit&#8217;ll be a blamed funeral!&#8221;
said Blair. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; to think that we
don&#8217;t grade up, nohow. First Vickers packs his
little war-bag an&#8217; goes hittin&#8217; the breeze out; an&#8217;
now you&#8217;ve got some fool notion that you ought
to pull <i>your</i> freight. If it&#8217;s anything botherin&#8217;
you, why, open your yap, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll sure salivate
that thing!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t mentionin&#8217;,&#8221; said Randerson. &#8220;But
it ain&#8217;t you boys. You&#8217;ve suited me mighty well.
I&#8217;m sure disturbed in my mind over leavin&#8217; you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why leave at all?&#8221; said Owen, his face
long.
</p>
<p>But Randerson evaded this direct question.
&#8220;An&#8217; you standin&#8217; in line for my job?&#8221; he said in
pretended astonishment. &#8220;Why, I reckon you
ought to be the most tickled because I&#8217;m goin&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it&#8217;s a go, I reckon we&#8217;ll have to
stand for it,&#8221; said Blair a little later, as Randerson
mounted his pony. Their parting words were
short, but eloquent in the sentiment left unsaid.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So long,&#8221; Randerson told them as he rode
away. And &#8220;so long&#8221; came the chorus behind
him, not a man omitting the courtesy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>They stood in a group, watching him as he
faded into the distance toward the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somethin&#8217; is botherin&#8217; him mighty bad,&#8221; said
Owen, frowning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s made the outfit feel like a lost doggie,&#8221;
grumbled Blair. &#8220;The blamed cuss is grievin&#8217;
over somethin&#8217;.&#8221; And they went disconsolately
to their work.
</p>
<p>Randerson rode on his way. He felt a little
relieved. No longer was he bound by his job;
he was now a free agent and could do as he
pleased. And it would please him to settle his
differences with Masten. He would &#8220;go gunnin&#8217;
for him&#8221; with a vengeance.
</p>
<p>It was about noon when he rode in to the
ranchhouse. He did not turn his pony into the
corral, but hitched it to one of the columns of
the porch, for he intended to go on to the
Diamond H as soon as he could get his belongings
packed. If his old job was still open
(he had heard that it was) he would take it, or
another in case the old one had been filled. In
any event, he would leave the Flying W.
</p>
<p>Dejection was heavy in his heart when he
crossed the porch to go to his room, for he had
liked it here; it had been more like the home of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
his ideals than any he had yet seen. For his
imagination and affection had been at work, and
in Aunt Martha he had seen a mother&mdash;such
a mother as he could have wished his own to be,
had she lived. And Uncle Jepson! The direct-talking
old gentleman had captivated him;
between them was respect, understanding, and
admiration that could hardly have been deeper
between father and son.
</p>
<p>But he felt reluctant to tell them of his decision
to go, he wanted to delay it&mdash;if possible, he
did not want to let them know at all, for he could
come here, sometimes, to see them, when Ruth
had gone. And so he was much pleased when,
entering the house, he did not see them. But he
looked for them, to be certain, going into all the
rooms. And finally from a kitchen window he
saw them out in the cottonwood back of the
house, walking arm in arm, away, deeper into the
wood. He turned with a gentle smile, and went
upstairs to his room.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Shortly after Abe Catherson&#8217;s departure from
the cabin, Ruth came to the door and looked out.
Her face was whiter than it had been when she
had reached the cabin, she was more composed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
and her eyes were alight with mingled resignation
and thankfulness. For Hagar had yielded her
secret, and Ruth had realized how near she had
come to linking her life with that of the despicable
creature who had preyed on her friend. The
son of this great waste of world loomed big in
her thoughts as she stood in the doorway; she
saw now that those outward graces which had
charmed her, in Masten, had been made to seem
mockeries in contrast to the inward cleanness
and manliness of the man that she had condemned
for merely defending himself when attacked.
</p>
<p>She went back into the cabin and sat beside
Hagar, a queer sensation of joy possessing her,
despite her pity for Hagar and her disgust for
Masten, for she knew in this instant that she
would never allow Randerson to quit the Flying
W. Her joy was infectious; it brought a
fugitive smile to the face of the nester&#8217;s daughter,
and as Ruth led her out upon the porch, her arms
around her, Hagar looked at her worshipfully.
</p>
<p>Out at the edge of the porch, Hagar shot a
dreading glance around. She started, and her
eyes filled with anxiety as her gaze rested on the
corral. She seized Ruth&#8217;s arm tightly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad&#8217;s gone!&#8221; she said gulpingly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, perhaps it is all for the best, Hagar,&#8221;
consoled Ruth. &#8220;He will ride for a while, and
he will come back to forgive you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the girl&#8217;s eyes grew wide with fear. &#8220;Oh,
I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll do somethin&#8217; terrible!&#8221; she
faltered. &#8220;Before you came, he asked me if&mdash;if
it had been Randerson. I told him no, but he
didn&#8217;t seem satisfied, an&#8217; when I wouldn&#8217;t tell
him who it was, he went out, cursin&#8217; Rex. I&#8217;m
afraid, Ruth&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid!&#8221; She glanced wildly
around, and her gaze rested on the piece of paper
that Catherson had left on the edge of the porch.
In an instant she had pounced upon it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone to kill Randerson!&#8221; she screamed
shrilly. She did not seem to see Ruth; the madness
of hysterical fear was upon her; her eyes
were brilliant, wide and glaring. She was in her
bare feet, but she darted past Ruth, disregarding
the rocks and miscellaneous litter that stretched
before her, reached Ruth&#8217;s pony and flung herself
into the saddle, her lips moving soundlessly
as she set the animal&#8217;s head toward the path.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay here!&#8221; she shouted to Ruth as the
Flying W girl, stunned to inaction by the other&#8217;s
manner, watched her. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to ketch dad.
Oh, durn him, the mis&#8217;able hot head!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>She hit the pony a vicious slap with a bare
hand. It lunged, as the reins loosened, reaching
its best speed within a hundred yards, but urged
to increasing effort by voice and hand and heel,
the girl leaning far over its mane, riding as she
had never ridden before. But up at the Flying
W ranchhouse, a tall, grim, bearded giant of a
horseman was just dismounting, his pony trembling
because of heart-breaking effort.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Randerson had not seen Ruth, of course. But
he had wondered much over her whereabouts
when he had been looking through the house for
Uncle Jepson and Aunt Martha. And when he
had seen them out in the cottonwoods, back of
the house, he had supposed her to be with them.
He was glad she was not here, to make these last
moments embarrassing. He would not disturb
her.
</p>
<p>He found pencil and paper and wrote his
resignation, sitting long over it, but making it
brief. It read:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going, ma&#8217;am. I&#8217;ve left Red Owen in
charge. I&#8217;m wishing you luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, that&#8217;s settled,&#8221; he said, rising. &#8220;But
I was hopin&#8217; it would be different. Dreams are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
silly things&mdash;when they don&#8217;t come true. I&#8217;ll be
soured on girls, hereafter,&#8221; he told himself,
morosely.
</p>
<p>He packed his war-bag. While engaged in this
work he heard the sound of hoofbeats, but he
paid no attention, though he colored uncomfortably,
for he thought he had been wrong
in thinking that Ruth had been in the cottonwood
grove, and that she had been away and was just
returning. And when he heard a soft tread
downstairs he was certain that it was she, and he
reddened again. He stopped his work and sat
silent, then he caught the sound of footsteps on
the stairs, for now he would have to face her.
When he saw the door of his room begin to swing
slowly back, he got up, his face grave, ready to
deliver his resignation in person. And when the
door swung almost open, and he saw Abe Catherson
standing in the opening, his heavy
pistol in hand, cocked, a finger on the trigger, he
stiffened, standing silent, looking at the intruder.
</p>
<p>Abe&#8217;s eyes still wore the frenzy that had been
in them when he had been speaking with Ruth.
If anything, the frenzy was intensified. His legs
were trembling, the big finger on the trigger of
his weapon was twitching; his lips, almost hidden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
by the beard, were writhing. He was like a man
who had been seized by some terrible illness
fighting it, resolved to conquer it through sheer
effort. His voice stuck in his throat, issuing spasmodically:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you, Randerson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;where&mdash;I
want you! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to kill you, empty my
gun in you! You mis&#8217;able whelp!&#8221; He took
two steps into the room and then halted, tearing
at the collar of his shirt with his free hand, as
though to aid his laboring lungs to get the air
they demanded.
</p>
<p>Randerson&#8217;s face was white and set, now. He
was facing death at the hands of a man whom
he had befriended many times. He did not know
Catherson&#8217;s motive in coming here, but he knew
that the slightest insincere word; a tone too light
or too gruff, the most insignificant hostile movement,
would bring about a quick pressure of the
trigger of Catherson&#8217;s pistol. Diplomacy would
not answer; it must be a battle of the spirit; naked
courage alone could save him, could keep
that big finger on the trigger from movement
until he could discover Catherson&#8217;s motive in
coming to kill him.
</p>
<p>He had faced death many times, but never had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
he faced it at the hands of a friend, with the
strong drag of regard to keep his fingers from
his own weapons. Had Catherson been an enemy,
he would have watched him with different
feelings; he would have taken a desperate chance
of getting one of his own pistols to work. But
he could not kill Catherson, knowing there was
no reason for it.
</p>
<p>He had no difficulty in getting genuine curiosity
into his voice, and he kept it to just
the pitch necessary to show his surprise over
Catherson&#8217;s threat and manner:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What you reckonin&#8217; to kill me for, Abe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For what you done to my Hagar!&#8221; The
convulsive play of Catherson&#8217;s features betrayed
his nearness to action. His gun arm stiffened.
He spoke in great gasps, like a man in delirium.
&#8220;I want you to know&mdash;what for. You come&mdash;sneakin&#8217;&mdash;around&mdash;givin&#8217;
me&mdash;money&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, there, Abe!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Randerson&#8217;s sharp, cold voice acted with the
effect of a dash of water in Catherson&#8217;s face. He
started, his big hand trembling, for though he
had come to kill, he unknowingly wanted to hear
some word from Randerson&#8217;s lips in proof of
his innocence. Had Randerson flinched, he would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
have taken that as a sign of guilt, as he now took
the man&#8217;s sternness as an indication of his
innocence. He stepped forward until he was no
more than a foot from Randerson, and searched
his face with wild intentness. And then, suddenly,
the weapon in his hand sank down, his legs
wavered, he leaned against the wall while his chin
dropped to his chest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t do it, Rex, you couldn&#8217;t do
it!&#8221; he muttered hoarsely. &#8220;No man who&#8217;d
done a thing like that could look back at me like
you looked. But I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to git&mdash;&#8221; He
stopped, for there was a rapid patter of feet on
the stairs, and a breathless voice, crying wildly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad! <i>Dad! Dad!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>And while both men stood, their muscles
tensed to leap into action in response to the voice,
Hagar burst into the room, looked at them both;
saw Catherson&#8217;s drawn pistol, and then threw
herself upon her father, hid her face on his breast
and sobbed: &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t Rex, dad; it was
Masten!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Catherson&#8217;s excitement was over. The first
terrible rage had expended itself on Randerson,
and after a violent start at Hagar&#8217;s words he
grew cold and deliberate. Also, the confession
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
seemed to make his resentment against his child
less poignant, for he rested his hand on her head
and spoke gently to her:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Hagar&mdash;it&#8217;s all right. Your
old dad ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to hold it ag&#8217;in you too hard.
We all make mistakes. Why, I was just goin&#8217; to
make a mighty whopper myself, by killing Rex,
here. You leave this to me.&#8221; He pushed her
toward Randerson. &#8220;You take her back to the
shack, Rex. I reckon it won&#8217;t take me long to do
what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do. I&#8217;ll be back afore dark,
mebbe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl clung to him for an instant. &#8220;Dad,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;What <i>are</i> you goin&#8217; to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you was a good guesser&mdash;&#8221; said Catherson
coldly. And then he grinned felinely at
Randerson and went out. They could hear him
going down the stairs. They followed presently,
Hagar shrinking and shuddering under Randerson&#8217;s
arm on her shoulders, and from the porch
they saw Catherson, on his pony, riding the trail
that Ruth had taken on the day she had gone to
see Chavis&#8217; shack.
</p>
<p>Randerson got Hagar into the saddle, recognizing
the pony and speaking about it. When she
told him that Ruth was at her cabin, his face
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
lighted. He thought about the written resignation
lying in his room, and he smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I come mighty near not havin&#8217; to use it,&#8221; he
said to himself.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>REALIZING A PASSION</h3>
</div>

<p>Ruth stood for a long time on the porch
after Hagar&#8217;s departure, gripped by
emotions, that had had no duplicates in all her
days. Never before had she thought herself
capable of experiencing such emotions. For the
man she loved was in danger. She knew at this
minute that she loved him, that she had loved him
all along. And she was not able to go to him;
she could not even learn, until Hagar returned,
whether the girl had been in time, or whether he
had succumbed to the blind frenzy of the avenger.
The impotence of her position did much to
aggravate her emotions, and they surged through
her, sapping her strength. It was hideous&mdash;the
dread, the uncertainty, the terrible suspense, the
dragging minutes. She walked back and forth
on the porch, her hands clenched, her face drawn
and white, praying mutely, fervently, passionately,
that Hagar might be in time.
</p>
<p>Thinking to divert her mind, she at last went
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
into the cabin and began to walk about, looking
at various objects, trying to force herself to take
an interest in them.
</p>
<p>She saw, back of a curtain, a number of the
dresses and other garments she had given Hagar,
and she could not disperse the thought that perhaps
if she had not given the clothing to
Hagar, Masten might not have been attracted to
her. She drew the curtain over them with something
near a shudder, considering herself not
entirely blameless.
</p>
<p>She endeavored to interest herself in Catherson&#8217;s
pipe and tobacco, on a shelf near the stove;
wondering over the many hours that he had
smoked in this lonesome place, driving away the
monotony of the hours. What a blow this must
be to him! She began to understand something
of the terrible emotions that must have seized
him with the revelation. And <i>she</i> had brought
Masten here, too! Innocent, she was to blame
there! And she unconsciously did something, as
she walked about, that she had never before
attempted to do&mdash;to put herself into other
persons&#8217; positions, to try to understand their
emotions&mdash;the motives that moved them to do
things which she had considered vicious and inhuman.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
She had forced her imagination to
work, and she succeeded in getting partial
glimpses of the viewpoints of others, in experiencing
flashes of the passions that moved
them. She wondered what she would do were
Hagar <i>her</i> daughter, and for an instant she was
drunken with the intensity of the passion that
gripped her.
</p>
<p>Before her trip around the interior of the
cabin was completed, she came upon a six-shooter&mdash;heavy,
cumbersome, like the weapon she had
used the day Randerson had taught her to shoot.
It reposed on a shelf near the door that led to
the porch, and was almost concealed behind a
box in which were a number of miscellaneous
articles, broken pipes, pieces of hardware, buckles,
a file, a wrench. She examined the weapon. It
was loaded, in excellent condition. She supposed
it was left there for Hagar&#8217;s protection. She restored
it to its place and continued her inspection.
</p>
<p>She had grown more composed now, for she
had had time to reflect. Catherson had not had
much of a start; he would not ride so fast as
Hagar; he did not know where, on the range, he
might find Randerson. Hagar was sure to catch
him; she <i>would</i> catch him, because of her deep
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
affection for Randerson. And so, after all, there
was nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>She was surprised to discover that she could
think of Masten without the slightest regret; to
find that her contempt for him did not cause her
the slightest wonder. Had she always known,
subconsciously, that he was a scoundrel? Had
that knowledge exerted its influence in making
her reluctant to marry him?
</p>
<p>Standing at a rear window she looked out at
the corral, and beyond it at a dense wood. She
had been there for about five minutes, her thoughts
placid, considering the excitement of the day,
when at a stroke a change came over her. At
first a vague disquiet, which rapidly grew into a
dread fear, a conviction, that some danger lurked
behind her.
</p>
<p>She was afraid to turn. She did not turn, at
once, listening instead for any sound that might
confirm her premonition. No sound came. The
silence that reigned in the cabin was every bit as
intense as that which surrounded it. But the
dread grew upon her; a cold chill raced up her
spine, spreading to her arms and to her hands,
making them cold and clammy; to her head,
whitening her face, making her temples throb.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
And then, when it seemed that she must shriek
in terror, she turned. In the doorway, leaning
against one of the jambs, regarding her with
narrowed, gleaming eyes, a pleased, appraising
smile on his face, was Tom Chavis.
</p>
<p>Her first sensation was one of relief. She did
not know what she had expected to see when she
turned; certainly something more dire and terrible
than Tom Chavis. But when she thought of
his past actions, of his cynical, skeptical, and
significant looks at her; of his manner at this
minute; and reflected upon the fact that she was
alone, she realized that chance could have sent
nothing more terrible to her.
</p>
<p>He noted her excitement, and his smile broadened.
&#8220;Scared?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be.&#8221;
His attitude toward her became one of easy
assurance. He stepped inside and walked to the
rough table that stood near the center of the
room, placing his hands on it and looking at her
craftily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you&mdash;eh?
Where&#8217;s Catherson? Where&#8217;s Hagar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone to the Flying W,&#8221; she
answered, trying to make her voice even, but not
succeeding. There was a quaver in it. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
must have seen them,&#8221; she added, with a hope that
some one at the ranchhouse might have seen <i>him</i>.
She would have felt more secure if she had known
that someone <i>had</i> seen him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; doin&#8217;,&#8221; he said, a queer leap in his
voice. &#8220;I come straight from the shack, by the
Lazette trail. How does it come that you&#8217;re
here, alone? What did Catherson an&#8217; Hagar go
to the Flyin&#8217; W for? How long will they be
gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be back right away,&#8221; she told him,
with a devout hope that they would.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lyin&#8217;, Ruth,&#8221; he said familiarly.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t know when they&#8217;ll be back.&#8221; He
grinned, maliciously. &#8220;I reckon I c&#8217;n tell you
why you&#8217;re here alone, too. Hagar&#8217;s took your
cayuse. Hagar&#8217;s is in the corral. You see,&#8221; he
added triumphantly as he saw the start that she
could not repress. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been nosin&#8217; around a
little before I come in. I wasn&#8217;t figgerin&#8217; on
runnin&#8217; into Abe Catherson.&#8221; He laughed
thickly, as though some sort of passion surged
over him. &#8220;So you&#8217;re all alone here&mdash;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She grew weak at the significance of his words,
and leaned against the window-sill for support.
And then with the realization that she must not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
seem to quail before him, she stood erect again
and forced her voice to steadiness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am alone. Is there any
need to repeat that? And being alone, I am in
charge, here, and I don&#8217;t want you here for
company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed, making no move to withdraw.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here on business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t have any business with me. Come
when the Cathersons are here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The waitin&#8217;s good,&#8221; he grinned. He walked
around to the side of the table, and with one
hand resting on its top, looked closely at her,
suspicion in his eyes. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he said in a confidential
whisper, &#8220;it looks peculiar to me.
Catherson an&#8217; Hagar both gone. Hagar&#8217;s got
your cayuse, leavin&#8217; you here alone. Has ol&#8217;
Catherson tumbled to Masten bein&#8217; thick with
Hagar?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said, flushing. &#8220;It is no
affair of mine!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t&mdash;eh?&#8221; he said with a laugh, low and
derisive. &#8220;You don&#8217;t care what Masten does-eh?
An&#8217; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to marry him, Monday.
Masten&#8217;s lucky,&#8221; he went on, giving her a look
that made her shudder; &#8220;he&#8217;s got two girls. An&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
one of them don&#8217;t care how much he loves the
other.&#8221; He laughed as though the matter were
one of high comedy.
</p>
<p>His manner, the half-veiled, vulgar significance
of his words and voice, roused her to a
cold fury. She took a step toward him and stood
rigid, her eyes flashing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You get out of this cabin, Tom Chavis!&#8221; she
commanded. &#8220;Get out&mdash;instantly!&#8221; No
longer was she afraid of him; she was resolute,
unflinching.
</p>
<p>But Chavis merely smiled&mdash;seemingly in
huge enjoyment. And then, while he looked at
her, his expression changed to wonder. &#8220;Holy
smoke!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Masten&#8217;s eyes? He
said you didn&#8217;t have any spirit, Ruth, that you
was too cold an&#8217; distant. I reckon Masten don&#8217;t
know how to size up a girl&mdash;a girl, that is, which
is thoroughbred. Seems as though his kind is
more like Hagar!&#8221; He grinned cunningly and
reached into a pocket, drawing out a paper. He
chuckled over it, reading it. Then, as though
she were certain to appreciate the joke, he held
it out to her. &#8220;Read it, Ruth,&#8221; he invited, &#8220;it&#8217;s
from Masten, askin&#8217; Hagar to meet him, tomorrow,
down the crick a ways. He&#8217;s dead scared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
to come here any more, since Randerson&#8217;s aimin&#8217;
to perforate him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Only one conscious emotion afflicted her at
this minute: rage over Chavis&#8217; inability to understand
that she was not of the type of woman
who could discuss such matters with a man.
Evidently, in his eyes, all women were alike. She
knew that such was his opinion when, refusing to
take the paper, she stepped back, coldly, and he
looked at her in surprise, a sneer following
instantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to read it&mdash;eh? Not interested?
Jealous, mebbe&mdash;eh?&#8221; He grinned. &#8220;Sure&mdash;that&#8217;s
it, you&#8217;re jealous.&#8221; He laughed gleefully.
&#8220;You women are sure jokes. Masten
can&#8217;t wake you up&mdash;eh? Well, mebbe
Masten&mdash;&#8221; He paused and licked his lips. &#8220;I
reckon I don&#8217;t blame you, Ruth. Masten ain&#8217;t the
sort of man. He&#8217;s too cold-blooded, hisself to
make a woman sort of fan up to him. But there&#8217;s
other guys in this country, Ruth, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had seized the first thing that came to her
hands, a glass jar that had set on the window sill
behind her, and she hurled it furiously and accurately.
It struck him fairly on the forehead and
broke into many pieces, which clattered and rang
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
on the bare board floor. The sound they made,
the smashing, dull impact as the jar had struck
Chavis, caused her heart to leap in wild applause&mdash;twanging
a cord of latent savagery in her that
set her nerves singing to its music. It was the first
belligerent act of her life. It awakened in her
the knowledge that she could defend herself, that
the courage for which she had prayed that night
when on the rock where Randerson had found
her, was lurking deep, ready to answer her
summons. She laughed at Chavis, and when she
saw him wipe the blood from his face and look at
her in bewilderment, she challenged him
peremptorily:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go&mdash;now, you beast!&#8221;
</p>
<p>His answer was a leering grin that made his
face hideous. He looked like a wounded animal,
with nothing but concentrated passion in his eyes.
Her act had maddened him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix you, you hussy!&#8221; he sneered cursing.
</p>
<p>She saw now that he was aroused past all restraint,
and when he came toward her, crouching,
she knew that other missiles would not suffice,
that to be absolutely safe she must get possession
of the big pistol that reposed on the shelf near
the door. So when he came toward her she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
slipped behind the table. He grasped it by its
edge and tried to swing it out of the way, and
when she held it he suddenly swooped down, seizing
it by the legs and overturning it. As it
fell he made a lunge at her, but she eluded him
and bounded to the door. The box holding the
miscellaneous articles she knocked out of its place,
so that it fell with a tinkling crash, throwing its
contents in all directions. Her fingers closed on
the stock of the pistol, and she faced Chavis, who
was a few feet away, leveling the big weapon at
him. Her voice came firmly; she was surprised
at her own calmness:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move, Chavis, don&#8217;t dare to take a
step, or I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Chavis halted, his face a dirty, chalkish white.
Twice his lips opened, in astonishment or fear,
she could not tell which, but no sound came from
them. He stood silent, watching her, furtive-eyed,
crouching.
</p>
<p>In this interval her thoughts rioted in chaos,
like dust before a hurricane. But a question
dominated all: could she carry out her threat to
kill Chavis, if he took the step?
</p>
<p>She knew she would. For in this crisis she had
discovered one of nature&#8217;s first laws. She had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
never understood, before, but in the last few
minutes knowledge had come to her like a burst
of light in the darkness. And a voice came to
her also&mdash;Randerson&#8217;s; she mentally repeated
the words he had spoken on the day he had told
her about the rustlers: &#8220;I reckon you&#8217;d fight like
a tiger, ma&#8217;am, if the time ever come when you
had to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yes, she would fight. Not as a tiger would
fight, but as Randerson himself had fought&mdash;not
with a lust to do murder, but in self-protection.
And in this instant the spirit of Randerson seemed
to stand beside her, applauding her, seeming to
whisper words of encouragement to her. And
she caught something of his manner when danger
threatened; his cold deliberation, his steadiness
of hand and eye, his grim alertness. For she had
unconsciously studied him in the few minutes preceding
the death of Pickett, and she was as
unconsciously imitating him now.
</p>
<p>Her thoughts ceased, however, when she saw
Chavis grin at her, mockingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bluff!&#8221; he said. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t hit the
ground, if you had a-hold of the gun with both
hands!&#8221; He moved slightly, measuring the
distance between them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>Plainly, she saw from his actions, from his
tensed muscles, her threat would not stop him.
She was very pale, and her breast heaved as
though from a hard run; Chavis could hear the
sound of her breathing as he set himself for a
leap; but her lips were pressed tightly together,
her eyes glowed and widened as she followed the
man&#8217;s movements. She was going to kill; she
had steeled her mind to that. And when she saw
the man&#8217;s muscles contract for the rush that he
hoped would disconcert her, she fired, coolly and
deliberately.
</p>
<p>With the deafening roar of the weapon in her
ears, a revulsion, swift, sickening, overcame her.
The report reverberated hideously; she seemed
to hear a thousand of them. And the smoke
billowed around her, strong, pungent. Through
it she saw Chavis stagger, clap one hand to his
chest and tumble headlong, face down, at her
feet. The interior of the cabin whirled in mad
circles; the floor seemed to be rising to meet her,
and she sank to it, the six-shooter striking the
bare boards with a thud that sounded to her like
a peal of thunder. And then oblivion, deep and
welcome, descended.
</p>
<p>Coming down through the break in the canyon,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
riding slightly in advance of Hagar, Randerson
heard the report of a pistol, distant and muffled.
He turned in the saddle and looked at Hagar
questioningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That come from your shack!&#8221; he said
shortly; &#8220;Ruth there alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He caught the girl&#8217;s quick affirmative, and
Patches leaped high in the air from pain and
astonishment as the spurs pressed his flanks.
When he came down it was to plunge forward
with furious bounds that sent him through the
water of the river, driving the spume high over
his head. He scrambled up the sloping further
bank like a cat, gained the level and straightened
to his work. Twice that day had riders clattered
the narrow trail with remarkable speed, but
Patches would have led them.
</p>
<p>He was going his best when within fifty feet of
the shack he heard Randerson&#8217;s voice and slowed
down. Even then, so great was his impetus, he
slid a dozen feet when he felt the reins, rose to
keep from turning a somersault, and came down
with a grunt.
</p>
<p>In an instant Randerson was inside the cabin.
Ruth lay prone, where she had fallen. Randerson,
pale, grim-lipped, leaned over her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fainted!&#8221; he decided. He stepped to the
man and turned him over roughly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chavis,&#8221; he ejaculated, his lips hardening.
&#8220;Bored a-plenty!&#8221; he added, with vindictive
satisfaction. He saw Ruth&#8217;s weapon, noted the
gash in Chavis&#8217; forehead, and smiled. &#8220;I reckon
she fit like a tiger, all right!&#8221; he commented
admiringly. And now he stood erect and looked
down at Ruth compassionately. &#8220;She&#8217;s killed
him, but she&#8217;ll die a-mournin&#8217; over it!&#8221; Swift
resolution made his eyes flash. He looked again
at Ruth, saw that she was still in a state of deep
unconsciousness. Running out of the cabin, he
drew one of his six-shooters. When he had gone
about twenty-five feet from the edge of the porch,
he wheeled, threw the gun to a quick level, and
aimed at the interior of the cabin. At the report
he ran toward the cabin again, to meet Hagar,
just riding up, wide-eyed and wondering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is goin&#8217; on?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;What
you doin&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Killin&#8217; a man,&#8221; he told her grimly. He seized
her by the shoulders. &#8220;Understand,&#8221; he said
sternly; &#8220;<i>I</i> killed him, no matter what happens.
I&#8217;d just got here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With Hagar at his heels he entered the cabin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
again. While the girl worked with Ruth, he
went to the rear wall of the cabin and examined it.
When shooting from the outside he had aimed at
the wall near a small mirror that was affixed
there, and his eyes gleamed with satisfaction when,
embedded in one of the logs that formed the wall,
he found the bullet.
</p>
<p>Five minutes later he and Hagar led Ruth out
on the porch. The girl was shaking and cringing,
but trying hard to bear up under the recollection
of her terrible experience. She had looked, once,
at Chavis, on the floor of the cabin, when she
had recovered, and her knees had sagged. But
Randerson had gone to her assistance. She had
looked at him, too, in mute agony of spirit, filled
with a dull wonder over his presence, but gaining
nothing from his face, sternly sympathetic. Outside,
in the brilliant sunshine, a sense of time,
place, and events came back to her, and for the
first time since her recovery she thought of Abe
Catherson&#8217;s note, which Hagar had read.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, looking at Randerson with
luminous eyes, joy flashing in them, &#8220;he didn&#8217;t
shoot you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon not, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;I&#8217;m still
able to keep on range bossin&#8217; for the Flyin&#8217; W.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; she affirmed with a gulp of delight.
And she leaned her head a little toward him, so
that it almost touched his arm. And he noted,
with a pulse of pleasure, that the grip of her hand
on the arm tightened.
</p>
<p>But her joy was brief; she had only put the
tragedy out of her mind for an instant. It returned,
and her lips quavered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I killed Chavis, Randerson,&#8221; she said, looking
up at him with a pitiful smile. &#8220;I have
learned what it means to&mdash;to take&mdash;human
life. I killed him, Rex! I shot him down just
as he was about to spring upon me! But I had
to do it&mdash;didn&#8217;t I?&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;I&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t help it. I kept him off as long as I could&mdash;and
nobody came&mdash;and he looked so terrible&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ve got things mixed, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
Randerson met her puzzled look at him with a
grave smile. &#8220;It was me, ma&#8217;am, killed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She drew a sharp breath, her cheeks suddenly
flooded with color; she shook Hagar&#8217;s arm from
around her waist, seized Randerson&#8217;s shoulders,
gripping the sleeves of his shirt hard and staring
at him, searching his eyes with eager, anxious
intensity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lie to me, Randerson,&#8221; she pleaded.
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she went on, reddening as she thought of
another occasion when she had accused him, &#8220;I
know you wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;I know you <i>never</i> did! But
I killed him; I know I did! For I shot him,
Randerson, just as he started to leap at me.
And I shall never forget the look of awful surprise
and horror in his eyes! I shall never get
over it&mdash;I will never forgive myself!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks, ma&#8217;am, you&#8217;re plumb excited. An&#8217; I
reckon you was more excited then, or you&#8217;d know
better than to say you did it. Me an&#8217; Hagar
was just gettin&#8217; off our horses here at the door&mdash;after
comin&#8217; from the Flyin&#8217; W. An&#8217; I saw
Tom Chavis in the cabin. He was facin&#8217; the door,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said at a venture, and his eyes
gleamed when he saw her start, &#8220;an&#8217; I saw what
he was up to. An&#8217; I perforated him, ma&#8217;am.
From outside, here. Your gun went off at the
same time. But you ain&#8217;t learned to shoot extra
good yet, an&#8217; your bullet didn&#8217;t hit him. I&#8217;ll show
you where it&#8217;s stuck, in the wall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He led her inside and showed her the bullet.
And for a short space she leaned her head against
the wall and cried softly. And then, her eyes
filled with dread and doubt, she looked up at him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure that is my bullet?&#8221; she asked,
slowly. She held her breath while awaiting his
answer.
</p>
<p>It was accompanied by a short laugh, rich in
grave humor:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you wouldn&#8217;t compare your shootin&#8217;
with <i>mine</i>, ma&#8217;am. Me havin&#8217; so much experience,
an&#8217; you not bein&#8217; able to hit a soap-box
proper?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She bowed her head and murmured a fervent:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Randerson caught Hagar&#8217;s gaze and looked
significantly from Ruth to the door. The girl
accepted the hint, and coaxed Ruth to accompany
her to the door and thence across the porch to the
clearing. Randerson watched them until, still
walking, they vanished among the trees. Then
he took Chavis&#8217; body out. Later, when Ruth
and Hagar returned, he was sitting on the edge
of the porch, smoking a cigarette.
</p>
<p>To Ruth&#8217;s insistence that Hagar come with
her to the house, the girl shook her head firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad will be back, most any time. He&#8217;ll feel
a heap bad, I reckon. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve got to be here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little later, riding back toward the Flying
W&mdash;when they had reached the timber-fringed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
level where, on another day, Masten had received
his thrashing, Ruth halted her pony and faced her
escort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Randerson,&#8221; she said, &#8220;today Uncle Jepson
told me some things that I never knew&mdash;about
Masten&#8217;s plots against you. I don&#8217;t blame you
for killing those men. And I am sorry that I&mdash;I
spoke to you as I did&mdash;that day.&#8221; She held
out a hand to him.
</p>
<p>He took it, smiling gravely. &#8220;Why, I
reckoned you never meant it,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; she added, blushing deeply; &#8220;you are
not going to make it necessary for me to find
another range boss, are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d feel mighty bad if you was to ask me to
quit now,&#8221; he grinned. And now he looked at
her fairly, holding her gaze, his eyes glowing.
&#8220;But as for bein&#8217; range boss&mdash;&#8221; He paused,
and a subtle gleam joined the glow in his eyes.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a better job&mdash;that I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to ask
you for&mdash;some day. Don&#8217;t you think that I
ought to be promoted, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She wheeled her pony, blushing, and began to
ride toward the ranchhouse. But he urged
Patches beside her, and, reaching out, he captured
the hand nearest him. And in this manner they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
rode on&mdash;he holding the hand, a thrilling
exultation in his heart, she with averted head and
downcast eyes, filled with a deep wonder over
the new sensation that had come to her.
</p>
<p>Uncle Jepson, in the doorway of the house,
eagerly watching for the girl&#8217;s return, saw them
coming. Stealthily he closed the door and slipped
out into the kitchen, where Aunt Martha was at
work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Women is mighty uncertain critters, ain&#8217;t
they, Ma?&#8221; he said, shaking his head as though
puzzled over a feminine trait that had, heretofore,
escaped his notice. &#8220;I cal&#8217;late they never know
what they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to do next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Aunt Martha looked at him over the rims of
her spectacles, wonderment in her gaze&mdash;perhaps
a little belligerence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jep Coakley,&#8221; she said severely, &#8220;you&#8217;re
always runnin&#8217; down the women! What on earth
do you live with one for? What are the women
doin&#8217; now, that you are botherin&#8217; so much
about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He gravely took her by the arm and pointed out
of a window, from which Ruth and Randerson
could be seen.
</p>
<p>Aunt Martha looked, long and intently. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
when she finally turned to Uncle Jepson, her face
was radiant, and she opened her arms to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jep!&#8221; she exclaimed lowly, &#8220;ain&#8217;t that
wonderful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I cal&#8217;late I&#8217;ve been expectin&#8217; it,&#8221; he observed.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>A MAN IS BORN AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>The meeting between Catherson and Randerson
had taken the edge off Catherson&#8217;s
frenzy, but it had not shaken his determination.
He had been in the grip of an insane wrath when
he had gone to see the Flying W range boss. His
passions had ruled him, momentarily. He had
subdued them, checked them; they were held in
the clutch of his will as he rode the Lazette trail.
He did not travel fast, but carefully. There was
something in the pony&#8217;s gait that suggested the
mood of his rider&mdash;a certain doggedness of
movement and demeanor which might have meant
that the animal knew his rider&#8217;s thoughts and was
in sympathy with them. They traveled the trail
that Randerson had taken on the night he had
found Ruth on the rock; they negotiated the
plain that spread between the ranchhouse and the
ford where Randerson had just missed meeting
Ruth that day; they went steadily over the hilly
country and passed through the section of broken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
land where Ruth&#8217;s pony had thrown her. Reaching
the hills and ridges beyond, Catherson halted
and scrutinized the country around him. When
he observed that there was no sign of life within
range of his vision, he spoke to the pony and they
went forward.
</p>
<p>Catherson&#8217;s lips were set in a heavy, ugly pout.
His shaggy brows were contracted; somber, baleful
flashes, that betrayed something of those
passions that he was subduing, showed in his
eyes as the pony skirted the timber where Randerson
had tied Ruth&#8217;s horse. When he reached the
declivity where Ruth had overheard Chavis and
Kester, he dismounted and led his pony down it,
using the utmost care. He was conserving the
pony&#8217;s strength. For he knew nothing of what
might be required of the animal, and this thing
which he had determined to do must not be
bungled.
</p>
<p>He was still in no hurry, but he grew cautious
now, and secretive. He made a wide circuit of
the basin, keeping out of sight as much as possible,
behind some nondescript brush, riding in
depressions; going a mile out of his way to follow
the sandy bed of a washout. His objective was
Chavis&#8217; shack, and he wanted to come upon it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
unnoticed. Or, if that failed, he desired to make
his visit appear casual.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>But in Chavis&#8217; shack was a man who of late
had formed the habit of furtive watchfulness.
He wore a heavy six-shooter at his waist, but he
knew better than to try to place any dependence
upon his ability as a marksman. A certain meeting
with a grim-faced man on the Lazette trail
the night before, a vivid recollection of the grim-faced
man&#8217;s uncanny cleverness with a weapon,
demonstrated upon two occasions, worried him,
as did also some words that kept running through
his mind, asleep or awake, and would not be
banished. He could even hear the intonations
of the voice that had uttered them: &#8220;This
country is too crowded for both of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten was beginning to believe that. He had
thought that very morning, of leaving, of escaping,
rather. But Chavis had reassured him, had
ridiculed him, in fact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Randerson&#8217;s four-flushin&#8217;,&#8221; Chavis had
laughed. &#8220;He&#8217;s took a shine to Ruth, an&#8217; he&#8217;s
aimin&#8217; to scare you out. He&#8217;d sooner shoot a foot
off than bore you. &#8217;Cause why? &#8217;Cause if he
bored you he&#8217;d never have no chance to get next
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
to Ruth. She&#8217;s some opposed to him killin&#8217; folks
promiscuous. You lay low, that&#8217;s all. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll
rustle up a guy one of these days which will put
a crimp in Randerson. If he comes snoopin&#8217;
around here, why, there&#8217;s a rifle handy. Let him
have it, sudden&mdash;before he can git set!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Since he had sent Chavis with the note to
Hagar, Masten had been uneasy. He had not
stayed inside the shack for more than a minute or
two at a time, standing much in the doorway,
scanning the basin and the declivity carefully and
fearfully. And he had seen Catherson lead his
pony down. He went in and took the rifle from
its pegs.
</p>
<p>He had had a hope, at first, that it might be
Kester or Linton. But when he saw that the rider
did not come directly toward the shack a cold
sweat broke out on his forehead and he fingered
the rifle nervously. When he saw the rider disappear
in the washout, he got a chair from inside
and, standing on it, concentrated his gaze at the
point where the rider must emerge. And when,
a little later, he caught a glimpse of the rider&#8217;s
head, appearing for just an instant above the crest
of a sand ridge, noting the beard and the shaggy
hair, his face turned ashen and the chair rocked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
under him. For he knew but one man in this
country who looked like that.
</p>
<p>He got down from the chair and glared around,
his eyes dilated. Catherson&#8217;s actions seemed
innocent enough. But what could he be doing
in the basin? And, once here, what could he
mean by prowling like that, instead of coming
directly to the cabin? What could he be looking
for? Why did he not show himself?
</p>
<p>Masten slipped outside and crept along the wall
of the shack to a corner, from which, screened by
some alder, he watched breathlessly, a nameless
disquiet oppressing him. Did Catherson know
anything?
</p>
<p>That question his conscience dinned in his ears.
It was answered many times, as he stood there&mdash;an
insistent affirmative, suggested, proven by
Catherson&#8217;s actions, supported by the fact that
he had never seen Catherson in the basin before.
</p>
<p>As he watched, he saw Catherson again. He
was closer, riding behind a thicket of gnarled
brush, which was not high enough entirely to
conceal him, and he was bending far over in the
saddle as though he did not want to be seen. But
Masten could see him, and this last evidence of
the man&#8217;s caution convinced Masten. Obeying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
a sudden impulse, he threw the rifle to his
shoulder. The muzzle wavered, describing wide
circles, and before he could steady it enough to
be reasonably certain of hitting the target,
Catherson had vanished behind a low hill.
</p>
<p>Masten wiped the cold moisture from his forehead.
For an instant he stood irresolute,
trembling. And then, panic-stricken over a picture
that his imagination drew for him, he
dropped the rifle and ran, crouching, to the corral.
With frenzied haste, urged by the horrible conviction
that had seized him, he threw saddle and
bridle on his pony, and clambered, mumbling
incoherently, into the saddle. Twice the reins
escaped his wild clutches, but finally he caught
them and sat erect looking fearfully for
Catherson.
</p>
<p>The nester was not visible to him. Gulping
hard, Masten sent the pony cautiously forward.
He skirted the corral fence, keeping the shack
between him and the point at which he divined
Catherson was then riding, and loped the pony
into some sparse timber near the river.
</p>
<p>His panic had grown. He had yielded to it,
and it had mastered him. His lips were twitching;
he cringed and shivered as, getting deeper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
into the timber, he drove the spurs into the
pony&#8217;s flanks and raced it away from the shack.
</p>
<p>He rode for perhaps a mile at break-neck
speed. And then, unable to fight off the fascination
that gripped him, doubting, almost ridiculing
himself for yielding to the wild impulse to get
away from Catherson, for now that he was away
his action seemed senseless, he halted the pony
and turned in the saddle, peering back through
the trees. He had followed a narrow trail, and
its arching green stretched behind him, peaceful,
inviting, silent. So calm did it all seem to him
now, so distant from that dread danger he had
anticipated, that he smiled and sat debating an
impulse to return and face Catherson. The man&#8217;s
intentions could not be what he had suspected
them to be; clearly, his conscience had played him
a trick.
</p>
<p>But he did not wheel his pony. For as he sat
there in the silence he heard the rapid drumming
of hoofs on the path. Distant they were, but
unmistakable. For a moment Masten listened
to them, the cold damp breaking out on his forehead
again. Then he cursed, drove the spurs
deep into the pony and leaning forward, rode
frantically away.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>Coming out of the timber to a sand plain that
stretched in seeming endlessness toward a horizon
that was dimming in the growing twilight, Masten
halted the pony again, but only for an instant. In
the next he was urging it on furiously. For looking
back fearfully, he saw Catherson bestriding
his pony, a dread apparition, big, rigid, grim, just
breaking through the timber edge, not more than
two or three hundred feet distant. Masten had
hoped he had distanced his pursuer, for he
had ridden at least five miles at a pace that he had
never before attempted. There had been no way
for him to judge the pony&#8217;s speed, of course, but
when he had halted momentarily he had noted
that the animal was quivering all over, that it
caught its breath shrilly in the brief interval of
rest, and now as he rode, bending far over its
mane, he saw that the billowing foam on its
muzzle was flecked with blood. The animal was
not equal to the demands he had made upon it.
</p>
<p>But he forced it on, with spur and voice and
hand, muttering, pleading with it incoherently,
his own breath coughing in his throat, the muscles
of his back cringing and rippling in momentary
expectation of a flying missile that would burn
and tear its way through them. But no bullet
came. There was no sound behind him except,
occasionally, the ring of hoofs. At other times
silence engulfed him. For in the deep sand of
the level the laboring ponies of pursued and
pursuer made no noise. Masten could hear a
sodden squish at times, as his own animal whipped
its hoofs out of a miniature sand hill.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>
<img src='images/illus-322.png' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>
The grim, relentless figure behind him grew<br />
grotesque and gigantic in his thoughts
<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>He did not look around again for a long time.
Long ago had he lost all sense of direction, for
twilight had come and gone, and blank darkness,
except for the stars, stretched on all sides. He
had never seen this sand level; he knew it must
be far off the Lazette trail. And he knew, too,
before he had ridden far into it, that it was a
desert. For as twilight had come on he had
scrutinized it hopefully in search of timber, bushes,
a gorge, a gully&mdash;anything that might afford him
an opportunity for concealment, for escape from
the big, grim pursuer. He had seen nothing of
that character. Barren, level, vast, this waste of
world stretched before him, with no verdure save
the repulsive cactus, the scraggy yucca, the grease-wood,
and occasional splotches of mesquite.
</p>
<p>They raced on, the distance between them
lessening gradually. Masten could feel his pony
failing. It tried bravely, but the times when it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
spurted grew less frequent; it made increasingly
harder work of pulling its hoofs out of the deep
sand; it staggered and lurched on the hard
stretches.
</p>
<p>Masten looked back frequently now. The grim,
relentless figure behind him grew grotesque and
gigantic in his thoughts, and once, when he felt
the pony beneath him go to its knees, he screamed
hysterically. But the pony clambered to its feet
again and staggered on, to fall again a minute
later. Catherson&#8217;s pony, its strength conserved
for this ordeal, came on steadily, its rider carefully
avoiding the soft sand, profiting by Masten&#8217;s
experiences with it. It was not until he saw
Catherson within fifty feet of him that Masten
divined that he was not to be shot. For at that
distance he made a fair target, and Catherson
made no movement toward his gun. The nester
was still silent; he had spoken no word. He
spoke none now, as he hung relentlessly to his
prey, seeming, to Masten&#8217;s distorted mind and
vision, a hideous, unnatural and ghastly figure of
death.
</p>
<p>Catherson had drawn nearer. He was not
more than thirty feet away when Masten&#8217;s pony
went down again. It fell with a looseness and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
finality that told Masten of the end. And Masten
slipped his feet out of the stirrups, throwing himself
free and alighting on his hands and knees in
front of the exhausted animal. He got up, and
started to run, desperately, sobbing, his lips
slavering from terror. But he turned, after running
a few feet, to see Catherson coming after
him. The nester was uncoiling a rope from his
saddle horn, and at this sight Masten shrieked
and went to his knees. He heard an answering
laugh from Catherson, short, malevolent. And
then the rope swished out, its loop widening and
writhing. Masten shrieked again, and threw up
his hands impotently.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Later, Catherson brought his pony to a halt,
far from where the rope had been cast, and looked
grimly down at his fellow being, prone and
motionless in the deep sand at his feet.
</p>
<p>Unmoved, remorseless, Catherson had cut
short the pleadings, the screaming, the promises.
He had not bungled his work, and it had been
done. But as he looked down now, the muscles
of his face quivered. And now he spoke the first
word that had passed his lips since he had left
the Flying W ranchhouse:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ve got what&#8217;s been comin&#8217; to
you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got down, unfastened the rope, deliberately
re-coiled it and looped it around the saddle horn.
Then he mounted and rode away. Grim, indistinct,
fading into the blackness of the desert night,
he went, half a mile, perhaps. And then, halting
the pony, he turned in the saddle and looked back,
his head bent in a listening attitude. To his ears
came the sharp bark of a coyote, very near. It
was answered, faintly, from the vast, yawning
distance, by another. Catherson stiffened, and
lines of remorse came into his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; he exclaimed gruffly.
</p>
<p>He wheeled the pony and sent it scampering
back. A little later he was kneeling at Masten&#8217;s
side, and still later he helped Masten to the
saddle in front of him and set out again into the
desert blackness toward the timber from which
they both had burst some time before.
</p>
<p>Many hours afterward they came to the
river, at the point where the Lazette trail intersected.
There, in the shallow water of the ford,
Masten washed from his body the signs of his
experience, Catherson helping him. Outwardly,
when they had finished, there were few marks on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
Masten. But inwardly his experience had left
an ineffaceable impression.
</p>
<p>After washing, he staggered to a rock and sat
on it, his head in his hands, shivers running over
him. For a time Catherson paid no attention to
him, busying himself with his pony, jaded from
the night&#8217;s work. But after half an hour, just as
the first faint shafts of dawn began to steal up
over the horizon, Catherson walked close, and
stood looking down at his victim.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, slowly and passionlessly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you this far. I&#8217;m quittin&#8217; you. I
reckon I&#8217;ve deviled you enough. I was goin&#8217; to
kill you. But killin&#8217; you wouldn&#8217;t have made
things right. I expect you&#8217;ve learned somethin&#8217;,
anyway. You&#8217;ll know enough to play square,
after this. An&#8217; wherever you go&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Masten looked up at him, his face haggard, his
eyes brimming, but flashing earnestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to Hagar,&#8221; he said. He
shivered again. &#8220;You&#8217;re right, Catherson,&#8221; he
added, his voice quavering; &#8220;I learned a lot
tonight. I&#8217;ve learned&mdash;&#8221; His voice broke, and
he sat there grim and white, shuddering as a child
shudders when awakened from a nightmare. He
almost collapsed when Catherson&#8217;s huge hands
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
fell to his shoulders, but the hands held him, the
fingers gripping deeply into the flesh. There was
a leap in Catherson&#8217;s voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re almost a man, after all!&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>They got on the pony after a while, riding as
before, Masten in front, Catherson behind him,
steadying him. And in this manner they rode on
toward Catherson&#8217;s shack, miles down the river.
</p>
<p>It was late in the morning when they came in
sight of the shack, and seeing them from afar
Hagar ran to them. She stopped when she saw
Masten, her eyes wide with wonder and astonishment
that changed quickly to joy as she saw a
smile gathering on Catherson&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought you your husband, Hagar,&#8221; he
told her.
</p>
<p>Hagar did not move. Her hands were pressing
her breast; her eyes were eloquent with doubt
and hope. They sought Masten&#8217;s, searchingly,
defiantly. And she spoke directly to him, proudly,
her head erect:
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve come ag&#8217;in your will&mdash;If dad had
to bring you&mdash;&#8221; She paused, her lips trembling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks,&#8221; said Catherson gently; &#8220;he&#8217;s come
on his own hook, Hagar. Why, he asked me to
bring him&mdash;didn&#8217;t you, Masten?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></p>
<p>And then he dismounted and helped Masten
down, leading his pony forward toward the
shack, but turning when he reached the porch, to
look back at Masten and Hagar, standing together
in the shade of the trees, the girl&#8217;s head resting
on the man&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>Catherson pulled the saddle and bridle from
the pony, turned him into the corral, and then
went into the house. A little later he came out
again, smoking a pipe. Masten and Hagar were
sitting close together on a fallen tree near where
he had left them. Catherson smiled mildly at
them and peacefully pulled at his pipe.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>A DREAM COMES TRUE</h3>
</div>

<p>On the edge of the mesa, from which, on the
day of her adventure with the injured
ankle, Ruth had viewed the beautiful virgin wilderness
that stretched far on the opposite side
of the river, she was riding, the afternoon of a
day a week later, with Randerson. She had
expressed a wish to come here, and Randerson
had agreed joyfully.
</p>
<p>Seated on a rock in the shade of some trees
that formed the edge of that timber grove in
which he had tied Ruth&#8217;s pony on a night that
held many memories for both, they had watched,
for a long time, in silence, the vast country before
them. Something of the solemn calmness of the
scene was reflected in Ruth&#8217;s eyes. But there
was a different expression in Randerson&#8217;s eyes.
It was as though he possessed a secret which, he
felt, she ought to know, but was deliberately delaying
the telling of it. But at last he decided,
though he began obliquely:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s a set plan for the way things
turn out&mdash;for folks,&#8221; he said, gravely. &#8220;Things
turn out to show it. Everything is fixed.&#8221; He
smiled as she looked at him. &#8220;Take me,&#8221; he
went on. &#8220;I saw your picture. If I&#8217;d only seen
it once, mebbe I wouldn&#8217;t have fell in love with
it. But&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Rex!&#8221; she reproved with an injured
air, &#8220;how can you say that? Why, I believe I
loved you from the minute I saw you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have anything on me there!&#8221; he
told her. &#8220;For I was a gone coon the first time
I set eyes on <i>you!</i> But is it the same with pictures?
A picture, now, has to be studied; it ain&#8217;t
like the real article,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;Anyway,
if I hadn&#8217;t kept lookin&#8217; at your picture, mebbe
things would have been different. But I got it,
an&#8217; I looked at it a lot. That shows that it was
all fixed for you an&#8217; me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked mirthfully at him. &#8220;Was it all
fixed for you to take the picture from Vickers, by
force&mdash;as you told me you did?&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>He grinned brazenly. &#8220;I reckon that was
part of the plan,&#8221; he contended. &#8220;Anyway, I
got it. Vickers wouldn&#8217;t speak to me for a month,
but I reckon I didn&#8217;t lose any sleep over that.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
What sleep I lost was lost lookin&#8217; at the picture.&#8221;
The confession did not embarrass him, for he
continued quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; there&#8217;s Masten.&#8221; He watched the smile
go out of her face with regret in his eyes. But
he went on. &#8220;I intended to kill him, one night.
But he had no gun, an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t. That would
have spoiled the plan that&#8217;s fixed for all of us. I
let him live, an&#8217; the plan works out.&#8221; He took
hold of the hand nearest him and pressed it
tightly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen Hagar since?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she told him, looking quickly at him,
for she caught an odd note in his voice. &#8220;I just
couldn&#8217;t bear to think of going back there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Hagar&#8217;s happy. I was
over there this mornin&#8217;. Masten&#8217;s there.&#8221; He
felt her hand grip his suddenly, and he smiled.
He had talked with Catherson; the nester had
told him the story, but it had been agreed between
them the real story was not to be told. &#8220;They&#8217;re
married&mdash;Hagar an&#8217; Masten. Masten come to
Catherson&#8217;s shack the day after I&mdash;after I
brought you home from there. An&#8217; they rode
over to Lazette an&#8217; got hooked up. An&#8217; Catherson
had been lookin&#8217; for Masten, figurin&#8217; to kill
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
him. I reckon it was planned for Masten to have
a change of heart. Or mebbe it was gettin&#8217;
married changed him. For he&#8217;s a lot different,
since. He&#8217;s quiet, an&#8217; a heap considerate of other
folks&#8217; feelin&#8217;s. He&#8217;s got some money, an&#8217; he&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to help Abe to fix up his place. He asked
my pardon, for settin&#8217; Pickett an&#8217; Kelso on me.
I shook his hand, Ruth, an&#8217; wished him luck an&#8217;
happiness. Don&#8217;t you wish him the same, Ruth&mdash;both
of them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said earnestly; &#8220;I do!&#8221; And now
she was looking at him with luminous eyes. &#8220;But
it was very manly of you to forgive him
so fully!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it wasn&#8217;t so awful manly,&#8221; he returned,
blushing. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; else to
do, I expect. Would you have me hold a grudge
against him? An&#8217; spoil everything&mdash;nature&#8217;s
plan included? It was to happen that way, an&#8217; I
ain&#8217;t interferin&#8217;. Why, I reckon if I wasn&#8217;t to
forgive him, there&#8217;d be another plan spoiled&mdash;yours
an&#8217; mine. An&#8217; I&#8217;m sure helpin&#8217; to work
that out. I&#8217;ve thought of the first of the month,&#8221;
he said, looking at her, expectantly, and speaking
lowly. &#8220;The justice of the peace will be back in
Lazette then.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve been inquiring?&#8221; she said, her face
suffused with color.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sure! Somebody&#8217;s got to do it. It&#8217;s
my job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little later they mounted their ponies and
rode along the edge of the timber. When they
reached the tree to which he had tied her pony
on the night she had hurt her ankle, he called
her attention to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where I lost the bandanna,&#8221; he told
her. &#8220;It fell off my neck an&#8217; got tangled in the
knot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know!&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said, grinning; &#8220;Uncle Jepson told
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Uncle Jep has been your right hand
man all through this,&#8221; she charged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t he be?&#8221; he retorted. And
she could give him no reason why it should have
been otherwise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a rather mean trick to play on me,&#8221;
she charged pretending indignation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d have thought it mean, you&#8217;d have
told me about it before now,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;Patches was reliable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kester an&#8217; Linton have sloped,&#8221; he told her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
as they rode away from the trees. &#8220;This climate
was gettin&#8217; unhealthy for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes folks act so foolish?&#8221; he questioned,
later. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no way to escape
what&#8217;s got to be. Why can&#8217;t folks take their
medicine without makin&#8217; faces?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She knew he referred to Masten, Chavis and
Pickett, and she knew that this would be all the
reference Randerson would ever make to them.
But no answer formed in her mind and she kept
silent.
</p>
<p>When they came to the rock upon which he
had found her, he halted and regarded it gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had me scared that night,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Patches had most run his head off. I was
mighty relieved to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I treated you miserably that night,&#8221; she
confessed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear me complainin&#8217;?&#8221; he asked
with a gentle smile at her. &#8220;I expect, some day,
when we&#8217;re together more, an&#8217; you get to lovin&#8217;
me less than you do now, you&#8217;ll get peevish ag&#8217;in.
Married folks always do. But I won&#8217;t notice it.
I&#8217;ll get on Patches&mdash;if he&#8217;s alive, you wantin&#8217; to
put off the marriage so long&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Until the first!&#8221; she laughed, in gentle
derision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, with pretended gravity,
&#8220;when a man has waited, as long as I&#8217;ve waited,
he gets sort of impatient.&#8221; He grinned again,
and gave her this last shot: &#8220;An&#8217; mighty <i>patient</i>
after!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And they rode on again, through the white
sunlight, close together, dreaming of days to
come.
